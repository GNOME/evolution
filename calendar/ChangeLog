	Menu items updated to match the standards.  New Settings menu
 	created.

1998-12-30  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* gncal/calendar.c, gncal/gnome-cal.c, gncal/main.c,
	  gncal/quick-view.c:
	s/g_copy_strings/g_strconcat/

1998-12-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	Rewrote the old and broken alarm system.  It never actually
	worked properly.  Now it works properly, and I figured a nice way
	to get the Audio alarm do something nicer (it is now like an alarm
	clock :-). 
	
	* gnome-cal.c (calendar_notify): Now we take a CalendarAlarm to
	actually distinguish which alarm was triggered.

	* alarm.c (alarm_ready): The code was only activating the first
	alarm.  Reschedule the timer upon delivery of an alarm.

1998-12-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* year-view.c (idle_handler): Use the allocation size instead of
	the old fields in the canvas structure.

	* goto.c (create_days): Use gtk_widget_set_usize() instead of
	gnome_canvas_set_size().
	* quick-view.c (setup_event_list): Likewise.

1998-12-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-todo.c (simple_todo_editor): Use gnome_dialog_set_parent. 
	* goto.c (goto_dialog): ditto
	* prop.c (properties): ditto.

1998-11-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c (ee_rp_init_exceptions): Update GtkClist usage. 

1998-11-23  Andrew T. Veliath  <andrewtv@usa.net>

	* gncal-day-panel.c (gncal_day_panel_new): Use
	gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport instead of
	gtk_container_add (gtk changes).

1998-11-23  Herbert V. Riedel <hvr@hvrlab.ml.org>

	* eventedit.c: use GPOINTER_TO_INT 

	* gncal-todo.c: same.

1998-11-22  Matthew Wilson  <msw@redhat.com>

	* main.c: Fixed the popt event parsing callback to have the
	correct number of arguments.  This stops it from segfaulting.

1998-11-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c (ee_classification_widgets): Doh.  Fixed stupid bug
	where the classification buttons were not being set correctly.
	(ee_store_general_values_to_ical): Take into account the fact that
	radio group lists are stored in reverse order of insertion.

	* gncal-todo.c (gncal_todo_init): Use a scrolled window to put the
	clist into.

1998-11-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* calendar.c (calendar_save): Backup the old file before saving
	the caledar.

1998-11-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* calobj.c: Add ctype.h

1998-10-31  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_direction): Add the offset from the
	beginning of the current time unit (day/month/etc), otherwise it
	does not work right, for example, you are on the 31st day of a
	month and the next month is a 30-day one and you jump to the next
	month.

1998-10-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* month-view.c: Changed a lot of stuff not to use the layout code
	-- the month view's days are too small to display layout
	usefully.  Now they display a little list of the events in each
	day.  We also have a popup menu for the days in the month view.

	* calendar.c (calendar_get_objects_in_range): Reverse the list so
	that it is returned in increasing order.

	* eventedit.c (event_editor_new_whole_day): New public function to
	create an event for the complete span of day_begin to day_end.

	* year-view.c (new_appointment): Use event_editor_new_whole_day().

1998-10-12  Ji Lee <g@ucsd.edu>

	* eventedit.c (ee_store_recur_rule_to_ical): The interval was
	never being loaded from the spin button.

1998-10-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* month-view.c (month_view_update): Create a list of children and
	lay them out nicely.  Lots of functions added for this purpose.
	(adjust_segment): Main event segment adjustment routine.
	(adjust_children): Adjusts all the children in the month view.
	(child_create_segments): Creates the segments for a particular event.
	(layout_children): Uses the generic layout engine to organize the children.

1998-10-08  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-todo.c (clist_row_selected): Set the sensitivity of the
	edit/delete buttons.
	(gncal_todo_update): Likewise.  Thanks to Dirk Luetjens for the
	bug report.

	* layout.c: Do some cleanup; now we pass a struct with the layout
	algorithm's state instead of passing a trillion parameters around.

	* gncal-full-day.c (layout_children): Use the new generic layout
	engine.
	(child_compare): Sort keys are start time then end time, not just
	start time.  This produces somewhat nicer results for the layout
	algorithm.

	The new layout code uses a partition of the time range occupied by
	the events, rather than using a fixed time granularity.  This is
	better since the different parts of the program that use the
	layout module will have different semantics regarding snapping the
	event bounds to a fixed "time grid".

1998-10-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* layout.[ch]: New files that abstract the event layout code from
	gncal-full-day.c into something useful for other parts of the
	program.  Now all event layout is done here.

	* Makefile.am (gnomecal_SOURCES): Added layout.[ch] to the list of
	sources.

1998-10-07  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	'gnome_master_client'.

1998-10-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* timeutil.c (time_day_begin): Changed name from
	time_start_of_day() to be consistent with the other begin/end functions.
	(time_day_end): Likewise.

	* calobj.c (ical_object_get_first_weekday): New public function to
	get the first toggled day in a weekday mask.  Since we do not
	support multiple weekdays in a monthly-by-pos rule, we just fetch
	the first toggled one.
	(ical_object_generate_events): Added a missing break statement.

	* timeutil.c (time_month_end): Made it consistent with the rest of
	the time begin/end functions -- now it returns the first second of
	the *next* month.
	(time_week_end): Actually implemented this function.  It will be
	used when the week view is rewritten.

	* calobj.c (time_in_range): Fix off-by-one in the comparison of
	the time against the end time.

	* gncal-full-day.c (expand_space): Fixed bug where the columns not
	were being expanded due to a missing "slot + j".

	month item appropriately.

	* month-view.h: Added year and month fields to the MonthView
	structure.

	* main.c: Renamed the Appointments color property, since it will
	be used by the month view as well.

	* goto.c (update): Set the current day's font and color.

	* year-view.c (year_view_init): Set the fonts of the month items
	when creating them.

	* mark.h: Added new #defines for HEADING_FONT and TITLE_FONT.

	* year-view.c (year_view_init): Use the new font #defines.

	* prop.c (prop_apply_colors): Fixed to work with the
	I-am-paranoid-and-I-need-to-size-my-ints changes to
	GnomeColorPicker.
	(color_spec_from_picker): Likewise.

1998-09-30  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* goto.c (create_days): Colorify the month item and prepare it for
	prelighting here.

	* main.c (color_props):  Changed the default colors to something
	not dull.

	* year-view.c (compute_min_size): New function to compute the
	minimum size of the year view properly.
	(year_view_size_request): Added two new fields to the year view
	structure that contain the minimum size.  Return this in the
	size_request method.
	(year_view_new): Call compute_min_size to save the minimum size
	for later use.
	(idle_handler): Make it resize the items correctly.

	* gnome-month-item.c (gnome_month_item_set_arg): Reshape when
	necessary.  This is needed becaues we now actually calculate a
	minimum size for the month item based on the font sizes and paddings.
	(check_heading_sizes): New function to calculate a minimum size
	based on the headings' dimensions.
	(check_day_sizes): New function to calculate a minimum size based
	on the day number labels' dimensions.
	(check_sizes): New function that computes a minimum size for the
	month item.
	(reshape): Now calls check_sizes() to ensure a minimum size for
	the month item.

	* year-view.c (mark_current_day): New function to mark the current
	day in the year view.

	* mark.c: Removed mark_current_day from here.

1998-09-29  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* prop.c (fetch_color_spec): Changed name from fetch_prelight_spec
	and made it conform to the new prelighting mechanism.
	(fake_mark_days): Set the proper day attributes.
	(reconfigure_month): Use colorify_month_item().
	(fake_mark_days): Use mark_month_item_index().

	* mark.c (colorify_month_item): New public function to reset the
	colors in a month item.
	(get_attributes): New internal function that creates an array of
	attributes for the days in a month item.  This is the basis of all

	by index.
	(mark_event_in_month): Use mark_month_item_index().

	int, not a GnomeMonthItemChild.
	(gnome_month_item_child2num): Now returns an int, not a
	GnomeMonthItemChild.
	(gnome_month_item_num2day): Now takes an int, not a
	GnomeMonthItemChild.

	* goto.c (goto_dialog): Create the days before the year spin
	button, because the year_changed callback expects the month item
	to be created.  The new semantics of the spin button cause it to
	emit a value_changed signal on the adjustment upon creation -- is
	this the behavior we want from it?
	(goto_dialog): Use gtk_window_set_modal() instead of the
	deprectaed gnome_dialog_set_modal().

	* quick-view.c (quick_view_new): Make it look not as crappy by
	putting the title inside the frame.
	(quick_view_do_popup): Fixed the pointer grab and added a cursor.
	(create_items_for_event): Query the text width/height from the
	text item using the new object arguments, so that the size of the
	popup window can be set properly.

	* main.c: Use a watch cursor while the previous/today/next
	functions are doing their job.

	* mark.c (month_item_prepare_prelight): New public utility
	function to prepare a month item for prelighting.  It will store
	the proper prelight information and attach the appropriate signals.
	(mark_current_day): Make the current day bold as well (useful for
	color-blind people, I guess).

	* prop.c (set_current_day): Reset the date in the sample calendar
	and mark the current day.

	is done behind the scenes now.
	(update): Use the general prelighting engine.

	* gnome-month-item.h (struct _GnomeMonthItem): Added fields for
	outline and day box colors.

	* gnome-month-item.c (gnome_month_item_set_arg): Added
	outline_color, outline_color_gdk, day_box_color, and
	day_box_color_gdk arguments to month items.  These are convenient
	to quickly set the colors of the month item.
	(gnome_month_item_get_arg): Likewise.

	* main.[ch]: Added a global array of structures for color preferences.

1998-08-31  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* year-view.c (unmark_days): Use unmark_month_item().

	* gncal-full-day.c (gncal_full_day_destroy): Fixed crash when
	destroying the full day view.  The full day's destroy method is
	unusual in that it destroys the list of child widgets itself, as
	it does not have a remove method, so it needs to reset the list to
	NULL.

1998-08-27  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-month-item.c (build_month): Now does the correct thing

	1, not 1900.
	(time_year_end): Likewise.

	* year-view.c (year_view_size_allocate): Now changing the size of
	the calendars is done in the idle loop.
	(idle_handler): This function actually does the resizing of the items.

	* year-view.h (struct _YearView): Added idle_id and need_resize
	fields.

1998-08-26  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	marking needs to be finished.

	* gnome-cal.c: Updated for year-view.
	(gnome_calendar_time_format_changed): Use year_view_time_format_changed().

	* year-view.[ch]: Renamed the gncal-year-view.[ch] files to

	* prop.c (build_two_radio_group): Doh.  Set the state of the radio
	buttons properly.

	function that notifies the month view of a time format change.

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_time_format_changed): New public
	function that notifies the calendar of a time format change.

	* main.c (time_format_changed): Use gnome_calendar_time_format_changed().

	* month-view.c (month_view_update): New public function to update
	the month view when an event changes.  This is still unfinished.
	(month_view_set): New public function to set the month in the
	month view.

	are global application preferences, not a single calendar's
	properties.

	configuration file.
	(properties): Added a check button for weeks starting on Monday.

	* main.c (new_calendar): Made title i18n friendly. This was bug
	#215.

	* eventedit.c (ee_store_recur_end_to_ical): Set recur->enddate to

	* gnome-cal.c (calendar_notify): Apply black magic to get mail
	notifications to work.

	* gncal-full-day.c (child_focus_out): Temporary optimization, the

	descend from VBox so that we can add a label to it.
	(gncal_week_view_set): Display the ending day of the week

	keystroke (not just Return) will activate the selected range.

	* gncal-full-day.c (paint_back): Made it use the new paint_row
	function instead of painting everything directly.  We calculate
	areas in a smarter way so there is even less flicker than before,
	especially when selecting regions.

	* eventedit.c: Sensitize recurrence widgets properly.

	* calobj.c (duration_callback): Pass the correct pointer type to

1998-04-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* eventedit.c (ee_store_alarm): Use menu_shell->children, not

	(check_times): In addition to checking whether the event spans the
	whole day, now it insures that start_time < end_time.

	* gncal-full-day.c (child_set_size): Now children get bigger
	temporarily while they are focused.  This allows the handles not
	to "overlap" the rows used by the child and thus allow editing of
	very thin events.
	(recompute_motion): Fix for new child coordinates.
	(gncal_full_day_expose): Make it use find_child_by_window()

	* gncal-full-day.c (find_child_by_window): Compare child's widget
	windows by user_data (which will be the parent widget, that is,
	the text widget).  We cannot assume that child->widget->window
	will be *the* window we are interested on because there may be
	child widgets with multiple windows.

1998-04-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* calobj.c (ical_foreach): Define iterator routine.

1998-04-15  Arturo Espinosa Aldama  <arturo@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	flags parameters.
	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_update): Likewise.
	* gncal-full-day.c (gncal_full_day_update): Likewise.
	(child_focus_in): New function.  In conjunction with
	child_focus_out(), these only display the handles in the child
	when it is focused.  The result is that the user can see more of
	the child's text when nothing is focused, and we can also display
	fatter and nicer drag handles.

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_object_changed): Now takes an
	additional flags parameter
	(gnome_calendar_update_all): Made function static.  Now takes
	changed object and flags parameters as well.

	the full day widget.

	* eventedit.c (event_editor_setup_time_frame): Re-aligned some

	add it to the calendar.  You can now select a range in the
	full-day view, hit Return, and a new event will be added at the
	selected range.  I still have to figure out how to focus this new child.

	* gncal-full-day.c (paint_back): Rewrote function to avoid
	painting an area more than once -- eliminate flicker.
	(paint_back_rows): New function that calls paint_back() only for
	the area of the specified rows.
	(gncal_full_day_button_press):
	(gncal_full_day_button_release):
	(gncal_full_day_motion): Made these functions use
	paint_back_rows() instead of paint_back(), to eliminate flicker.  Wheee!

1998-04-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-cal.c (setup_day_view): We now connect to the

	"range_activated".  It is emitted when a range is selected and the
	user hits Return.
	(gncal_full_day_selection_range): New function, returns the
	selected range.

	* gncal-full-day.c (struct drag_info): Moved selection information
	to their own fields instead of sharing the child's drag fields.
	This allows us to keep the selection when a child is moved.
	(recompute_motion): Made the case when (row < di->sel_click_row)
	work correctly.

1998-04-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-cal.c (gnome_calendar_goto): Add support for navigating
	on the day view.

	* gncal-full-day.c (recompute_motion): Now we support selecting a
	range in the main window (by clicking+dragging).  It flickers
	horribly and is not perfect, but it is a start.

1998-04-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c: #include <string.h>

	gnome_calendar_object_changed() instead of updating manually.

	* calendar.c (calendar_add_object):

	Routines for time manipulation.

	* calobj.c (ical_object_destroy): Full destruction of the object.

	* view-utils.c (view_utils_draw_events): The "better" format

1998-04-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-full-day.c: New full-day widget.  It is still a work in

	(view_utils_draw_textured_frame): Ultra-nifty function to draw
	textured "metal" frames, like Netscape's handles.

1998-04-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_update): Day events are now

1998-04-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c (gncal_day_view_set_shadow): New customization
	function.  We can't decide on a stupid border type :-)
	(gncal_day_view_init): Made GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN be the default
	shadow type.  Looks good.

1998-04-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* main.c: New main program that uses our new datatypes and
	objects.

	* calendar.c (calendar_load_from_vobject, calendar_load):
	Implement loading of vCalendar objects and vCalendar files.

	* gncal-week-view.[ch]: New week view composite widget.  This
	provides a full week view (7 day views plus busy time display --
	the latter is currently unimplemented).

1998-04-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gncal-day-view.c: New day view widget.  It is intended to be a
	child widget of the week view composite widget.

	* calendar.c (calendar_get_objects_in_range):
	(calendar_get_events_in_range):
	(calendar_get_journal_in_range):
	(calendar_get_journal_in_range): These functions now take a
	sort_func parameter, which is of type GCompareFunc.  If the
	specified value is non-NULL, it will return a sorted list.
	Otherwise, it will return an unordered list.
	(calendar_compare_by_dtstart): Provide a generic sorting routine
	for calendar objects.

1998-04-01 Miguel de Icaza <miguel@kernel.org>

	hour/am_pm pair into a string of the form "3am", "12pm", "05h",

	* Now has (non working) session maangement
	* Uses a clist for the dailylist like gtt

Sat Mar 21 15:43:20 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* gncal.c: Use gnome_message_box_*, not gnome_messagebox_*.
