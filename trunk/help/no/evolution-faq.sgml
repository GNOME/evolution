	<question>
	  <para>
	   How can I use Evolution with Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
             If your server uses standard open protocols like IMAP,
             LDAP, POP, and SMTP, you can use Evolution with it.  You
             can share addresses with vCards and calendar items with
             iCal appointments.

	<question>
	  <para>
	     Can I use Evolution with KDE?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
             Evolution will work fine in KDE.  You will need to
             install all of the GNOME libraries that it depends on.
             Also, certain configuration options, such as default
             fonts and the message editor keybinding behavior, must be
             changed using the GNOME Control Center application (this
             will also run from within KDE).

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    How can I remove or rename a folder?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
            Right-click on the folder and select the
            <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem> or
            <guimenuitem>Rename</guimenuitem> items.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why doesn't drag and drop between folders seem to work?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    The implementation isn't finished, although it's nearly done.
  	  </para>

	  <para>
	    In the meantime, right-click on the folders or messages
	    you want to move, and select the
	    <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem> or
	    <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> options.

      <question>
	<para>
	  Can I read mail from a mailbox file created by some other
	  application (e.g. Mutt) without importing mail from it?
	</para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    No, but it's a planned feature.
	  </para>
	</answer> 
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can Evolution sync with my Palm OS (tm) device?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, it is not yet stable enough for general
	    release and we do not yet ship Evolution with Palm
	    synchronization enabled default. Until we do, you will
	    need to compile this in yourself. Check the
	    <filename>README</filename> file for additional
	    information on the requirements.  Full compatibility and
	    synchronization for calendar and addressbook applications
	    on Palm devices will be implemented and shipped soon.

      </qandaentry>
      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    What is the difference between a virtual folder (vfolder)
	    and a regular folder?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A virtual folder is like a saved search: it is a view of
	    your mail. Regular folders actually contain the mail
	    messages.  You can have one message be in multiple virtual
	    folders, but only in one regular folder.  See the section
	    in the Evolution manual about virtual folders for more
	    information.
	  </para>
	</answer> 
      </qandaentry>
      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can Evolution spell-check messages while I compose them?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes. The Evolution composer is able to highlight
	    mis-spelled word on the fly as you type them, and also
	    give you suggestions for possible corrections.  In order
	    for this to work you need the
	    <filename>gnome-spell</filename> component, which is not
	    shipped with Ximian GNOME yet.
 	 </para>

	  <para>
	    If you are brave enough, you can check out module
	    <filename>gnome-spell</filename> from the GNOME CVS and
	    compile it yourself.  Check out its README file for a list
	    of <filename>gnome-spell</filename>'s requirements for
	    compilation.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Note that you don't need to recompile Evolution after
	    installing <filename>gnome-spell</filename>; it will be
	    picked up automatically.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why can't I see the images that are contained in some HTML
	    mail messages.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
  	    Evolution currently doesn't support this, but it's a
	    planned feature.  It will be an option: many people like
	    to turn off the images because they use up bandwidth and can
            be used to spy on your email reading habits.
	  </para>
	</answer> 
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can I change the font that Evolution uses to compose and
	    display mail messages?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    You have to change the GtkHTML settings for that: in the
	    GNOME Control Center, go to the "HTML Viewer"
	    configuration page, which is under the "Document Handlers"
	    category.
	</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
            How do I import my Outlook <filename>.pst</filename> files into Evolution?
         </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
            You cannot import these files directly into Evolution
            because the <filename>.pst</filename> format is a
            proprietary format. However, Mozilla Mail on Windows can
            convert them into the <type>mbox</type> format, which can
            then be imported by Evolution.
          </para>
      
	  <para>
            To start importing your Outlook mail to Evolution, run
            Mozilla Mail on Windows and select the
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            to begin. Then select that you wish to import Mail from
            Outlook. Once Mozilla has imported all your mail, reboot
            your computer into Linux.
          </para>
      
          <para>
            Mount your Windows partition in Linux and run Evolution to
            begin importing your mail. Select
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import
            File...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to start importing. Set
            the file type to MBox (mbox) and click on
            <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> to select the mail you want
            to import.
          </para>
      
          <para>
            If you are the only user on Windows, the mail files will
            be stored in <filename>/mnt/c/windows/Application
            Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/XXXX/Mail/imported.mail/</filename>
            where <filename>/mnt/c/</filename> is your windows
            partition mount point and XXXX is some collection of
            numbers and digits ending in <filename>.slt</filename>.
          </para>
	  
	  <para>
            If there is more than one user, the file will be in
            <filename>/mnt/c/windows/Profiles/USERNAME/XXXX/Mail/imported.mail/</filename>
            where USERNAME is your Windows username.
         </para>

	  <para>
            For each mail folder in Outlook, Mozilla will convert the
            folder into one mbox file. To import all your mail, import
            all the files without a <filename>.msf</filename>
            extension.
           </para>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>
            If Mozilla can import <filename>.pst</filename> files, why can't Evolution?
          </para> 
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Mozilla on Windows accesses the <filename>.pst</filename>
            files through the <filename>MAPI.DLL</filename>, which is
            only available on Windows.  <filename>MAPI.DLL</filename>
            is the only way to access <filename>.pst</filename> files
            and Evolution cannot use this DLL in Linux.
          </para>
        </answer> 
      </qandaentry>
      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>
             Will there be an Evolution server? How about a text-based or web-based front end?
           </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Of course, we can't comment on unannounced future product
            plans, but Evolution's architecture would permit the
            existence of that kind of software. If there is enough
            demand for such software we will consider moving in that
            direction.

            How do I get Evolution from CVS?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            If you already have
            <ulink url="http://cvs.gnome.org">GNOME CVS</ulink> access,
            simply check out the following modules: evolution,
            gtkhtml, gal.
          </para>
          <para>
            If you don't have a CVS account, you can use anoncvs
            instead. Bear in mind that anoncvs is only synchronized once
            a day, and code received from anoncvs may not be latest
            version available.
          </para>

          <para>
            Before using the anoncvs server, you have to log into it.
            This only needs to be done once. Use this command:
          </para>

          <programlisting>
            cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome login
          </programlisting>

          <para>
            Then you can retrieve the modules needed to compile Evolution
            using the following command:
          </para>

          <programlisting>
            cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co evolution gtkhtml gal
          </programlisting>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>
            How should I compile Evolution avoiding conflicts with my
            existing GNOME installation?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The best way is to install Evolution into a separate prefix.
            In order to specify a non-default installation prefix, you
            can pass the <parameter>--prefix</parameter> option to
            <filename>configure</filename> or
            <filename>autogen.sh</filename>.  For example:
          </para>

          <programlisting>
            cd /cvs/evolution
            ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome
          </programlisting>

          <para>
            If you install Evolution and the Evolution libraries in a
            non-standard prefix, make sure you set the appropriate
            environment variables in the startup script for Evolution:
          </para>

          <programlisting>
            export PATH=/opt/gnome:$PATH
            export GNOME_PATH=/opt/gnome:/usr
          </programlisting>

          <para>
            You may also need to add <filename>$prefix/lib</filename>
            (e.g. <filename>/opt/gnome/lib</filename>) to your
            <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.  Of course, this will
            not work for systems which do not use ld.so.conf, such as
            HP-UX.

           This is a bug in GTK version 1.2.10. To avoid it, downgrade
           to GTK version 1.2.9, or install the Ximian version of GTK
           1.2.10.

          <para>
            I updated Evolution and now my addressbook information is gone!
            What should I do?
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            Evolution uses the <filename>libdb</filename> library to
            handle the addressbook database.  Two versions of
            <filename>libdb</filename> can be used with Evolution: version
            1.88 and version 2.
          </para>

          <para>
            Unfortunately, an Evolution executable that is linked against
            a certain version of <filename>libdb</filename> will only be
            able to read addressbook files written by another Evolution
            executable that is linked with the same version of the
            library.  If your addressbook is not readable by Evolution
            anymore, it probably means that you used to have Evolution
            linked with a certain version of <filename>libdb</filename>,
            but now it gets linked to a different version.
          </para>

          <para>
            Because of the way <filename>libdb</filename> is designed, it
            is not easy for Evolution to automatically do the conversion
            between the two formats.  But, if your Evolution used to be
            linked against version 1.85 and now is linked to version 2,
            there is a very simple way to convert the database and recover
            your data.

                You want version 1.85 there.  If your version is 2, then
                your current Evolution is probably linked against
                version 1.85 and you cannot convert the database to the
                old format. To do that, follow these instructions:

            This usually happens when a component tries talking a
            certain version of a CORBA interface to another component
            that supports a different version.  For example, this can
            happen when you recompile and install a single component
            without recompiling/installing the rest of Evolution.
          </para>

          <para>
            If you run into this problem, make sure all the components
            are compiled and installed at the same time.  This also
            applies to GtkHTML upgrades; after upgrading and
            installing a newer GtkHTML, always re-compile and
            re-install Evolution against it.

          <para>
            Evolution is actually made up of several components that run
            as separate processes.  Evolution's shell is not very good
            at cleaning up stale processes, so it is possible that
            sometimes already-running components cause unexpected and/or
            broken behavior.
          </para>

          <para>
            It's always a good idea to run <command>killev</command>
            after a crash in Evolution, especially if the Evolution
            shell itself crashed.  (If a component crashes instead, you
            should try to exit the shell cleanly first, so you give a
            chance to the other components to clean things up properly.)

             What is a stack trace (backtrace) and how do I get one?
           </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
              A stack trace is a list of the chain of function calls
              that lead to some point in the program. Typically, you
              want to get a stack trace when Evolution crashes or
              hangs and you want to try to figure out where in the
              code that happened and why. For this reason, stack
              traces are extremely useful for the Evolution
              developers, so it's important that you learn how to get
              them, and include them in crash reports. The
              <application>bug-buddy</application> tool can get and
              submit a stack trace for you.  If you want to do it by
              yourself, here's how:
          </para>
          <para>
             First of all, in order to get a stack trace, your
             executable (and possibly the libraries) must be compiled
             with debugging symbols. Debugging symbols are created by
             default if you compile from CVS, and are included in the
             snapshot builds. If you decide to compile by yourself
             with some custom CFLAGS value, make sure -g is included
             in them.
          </para>
          <para>
            Finally, you must put the component that crashes through
            <application>gdb</application>, the GNU debugging tool.
            To do so, make sure all the components are dead (exit
            Evolution and run <command>killev</command>), then run the
            following command:
               <programlisting>
                   <command>gdb name-of-component</command>
                </programlisting>
           
           Where "name-of-component" is the name of the component that
           crashed.
           </para>
           <para>
             Then, at the gdb prompt, type r (for "run") and wait a
             few seconds to make sure the component has registered
             with the name service. Then start
             <application>Evolution</application> normally from a
             different terminal.
           </para>
           <para>
             When you have started
             <application>Evolution</application>, reproduce the
             crash, and go back to the terminal where you ran gdb. If
             the component crashed, you should have a prompt there;
             otherwise, just hit Control+C. At the prompt, type
             <command>info threads</command>.  This will give you a
             screen that looks like this:
           </para>

           Now, for each of the threads listed, type the following commands:

          </para>
          <para>
            If you prefer, you can start gdb while a process is
            running. You'll want to do this right after a crash dialog
            appears, but before hitting "OK" or "Submit bug report".
            Start <application>gdb</application> as above, but instead
            of using <userinput>r</userinput>, type <userinput>attach
            PID</userinput> where PID is the process ID of the
            component you want to debug.
          </para>
          <para>
             If that sounds too complicated, you can always use
