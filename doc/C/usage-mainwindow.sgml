  <title>The Main Window: Evolution Basics</title>
  <para>
     Start <application>Evolution</application> by selecting
     <guimenuitem>Evolution</guimenuitem> from your
     <guimenu>Programs</guimenu> menu, or by typing
     <command>evolution</command> at the command line.  The first time
     you run the program, it will create a directory called
     <filename>evolution</filename> in your home directory, where it
     will keep all your <application>Evolution</application>-related
     files.  At this point, it will also offer to import old messages
     from other mail clients, such as Netscape mail.
   </para>
   <para>
     After <application>Evolution</application> starts up, you will
     see the <interface>main window</interface>, with the
     <interface>Inbox</interface> open.  It should look a lot like the
     picture in <xref linkend="usage-mainwindow-fig">. On the left of
     the <interface>main window</interface> is the <interface>shortcut
     bar</interface>, with several buttons in it.  Just underneath the
     title bar is a series of menus in the <interface>menu
     bar</interface>, and below that, the <interface>tool
     bar</interface> with buttons for different functions. The largest
     part of the <interface>main window</interface> is taken up by the
     content view, where your messages are displayed.  Above that is
     the message list view, where  a summary of your email is displayed.
     If you're running the program for the first time,
     you'll have one message: a welcome from Ximian.

    <title>The Shortcut Bar</title>
    <para>
        <application>Evolution</application>'s most important job is
        to give you access to your information and help you use it
        quickly.  One way it does that is through the
        <interface>shortcut bar</interface>, the column on the left
        hand side of the main window.  The large buttons with names
        like <guilabel>Inbox</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> are the shortcuts, and you can
        select different groups of shortcuts by clicking the
        rectangular group buttons.
    </para>

       Take a look at the <guilabel>Shortcut Bar</guilabel>
