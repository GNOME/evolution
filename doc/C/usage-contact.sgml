  <title>The Evolution Address Book</title>
  <abstract>
    <para>
      The <application>Evolution</application> address book can
      handle all of the functions of an address book, phone book, or
      Rolodex.  Of course, it's a lot easier to update
      <application>Evolution</application> than it is to change an
      actual paper book. <application>Evolution</application> also
      allows easy synchronization with hand-held devices.  Since
      <application>Evolution</application> supports the <glossterm
      linkend="ldap">LDAP</glossterm> directory protocol, you can use
      it with almost any type of existing directory server on your
      network.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another advantage of the <application>Evolution</application>
      address book is its integration with the rest of the
      application.  When you look for someone's address, you can also
      see a history of appointments with that person.  Or, you can
      create address cards from emails with just a few clicks.  In
      addition, searches and folders work in the same way they do in
      the rest of Evolution.
    </para>
    <para>
      This chapter will show you how to use the
      <application>Evolution</application> address book to organize
      any amount of contact information, share addresses over a
      network, and several ways to save time with everyday tasks. To
      learn about configuring the address book, see <xref
      linkend="config-prefs-contact">.

    <title>Getting Started With the Address Book</title>	
    
    <para>
       To open up your address book, click on
       <guibutton>Contacts</guibutton> in the shortcut bar, or select
       one of your contacts folders from the folder bar.  <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-fig"> shows the address book in all
       its organizational glory.  By default, the address book
       shows all your cards in alphabetical order, in a <glossterm
       linkend="minicard">minicard</glossterm> format.  You can select
       other views from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, and adjust
       the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the grey
       column dividers.

       The toolbar for the address book is quite simple:

	<listitem><para>
           <guibutton>New</guibutton> creates a new card.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>

	<listitem><para>
	    <guibutton>Print</guibutton> sends one or more of your cards to the printer.

        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para> <guibutton>View All</guibutton> displays all
           the address information in the folder.  Use this button to
           refresh the display for a network folder, or to switch from
           viewing the results of a search and see the whole contents.
           </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para> <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> stops loading

      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
       Your contact information fills the rest of the display.  Move
       through the cards alphabetically with the buttons and the
       scrollbar at the right of the window. Of course, if you have
       more than a few people listed, you'll want some way of finding
       them more quickly, which is why there's a search feature.

	   Between <guilabel>Delete</guilabel> and <guilabel>View
    	   All</guilabel> is a quick search field. To use it, select
    	   from the drop-down list which sort of search you'd like to

       The <guilabel>Details</guilabel> tab is, fortunately, much more

       the briefcase next to the details about the contact's
       professional life; the face next to the details about their
       personal life; the globe next to a big blank space you can use
       for anything and everything else you'd like to note about them.
       If you ever wanted to have that uncanny knack for remembering
       obscure details like the date of someone's anniversary (perhaps
       your own) this is the way to develop it.

    <title>Organizing your Address Book</title>
    <para>
       Organizing your address book is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the address book does not allow vFolders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <xref

      Another useful <application>Evolution</application> feature is

      <application>Evolution</application> will ask you if you wish to
      change the address for all of them, or just for one.

-->

    <sect2 id="usage-contact-organize-group">
      <title>Groups of contacts</title>
      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way that mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as members of
         different categories.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-folder">
	<title>Grouping with Folders</title>
	<para>
	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> folder.  If you've read <xref
	   linkend="usage-mainwindow"> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <menuchoice>
           <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	   <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
	   <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem>
           </menuchoice>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <xref
	   linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
	 </para>
	<para>
          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.
         </para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
	<title>Grouping with Categories</title>
	<para>
           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  The difference between folders
           and categories is that folders contain cards, but category
           membership is a property of each card.  That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </para>
	<para>
           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.
        </para>
	<para>
           Then, you can refer to all the cards in that category by:
           <!-- FIXME --> Waiting for Evolution to support the
           operation.
         </para>

       <!-- FIXME: Feature Not Implemented
	<para>

           If the master list of categories doesn't suit you, you can
           add your own.  Just enter the new category's name in the
           text box, then click <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> and
           choose <guilabel>Add to Master List</guilabel> in the
           window that appears.

  <sect1 id="usage-contact-sharing">
    <title>Sharing your Cards</title>
    <para>
       If you keep your cards on a network using an <glossterm
       linkend="ldap">LDAP</glossterm> server, you can share access to
       them, browse other address books, or maintain a shared set of
       contact information for your company or your department.  This
       is the sort of feature you'll want to use if your company has a
       list of vendors and clients that needs constant updating.  If
       share calendars as well as address books, people can avoid
       duplicating work and keep up to date on developments within
       their work-group or across the entire company.
    </para>

     <example id="usage-contact-sharing-ex">
	<title>Sharing Address Cards and Calendar Data</title>
	  <para>
	    Ray wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to
	    discuss his concerns for him.  Either way, he avoids

       overload the network with a list of babysitters or tell
       everyone in the office you're talking to new job prospects?  If
       you keep cards on your own computer, you can decide which items
       you want to make accessible to others.

       contact folders, see <xref linkend="config-prefs-contact">.
       Once you have a connection, the network contacts folder or
       folders will appear inside the <guilabel>External
       Directories</guilabel> folder in the folder bar.  It will work
       exactly like a local folder of cards, with the following
       exceptions:

              Network folders are only available when you are
              connected to the network.  If you use a laptop or have a
              modem connection, you may wish to copy or cache the
              network directory and then synchronize your copy with
              the networked version periodically.  <!-- FIXME: HOW? -->

    <title>Address Book Tools</title>
    <para>
       The address book works closely with
       <application>Evolution</application>'s mail and calendar tools.
       For example, you can use the address book to help you manage
       mailing lists, and send or recieve address cards over email.
       More tools are on the way, and when they arrive, <!-- FIXME -->
       they will be described in this section.

      <title>Send me a Card: Adding New Cards Quickly</title>
      <para>
	As noted before, when you get information about a person in
	the mail or in a calendar entry, you can add it to an address
	card.  To do so, right click on any email address or email
	message, and select <guimenuitem>Add Address
	Card</guimenuitem> from the menu that appears.  Of course,
	<application> Evolution</application> also adds cards from a
	hand-held device during HotSync operation.  For more
	information about that, see <xref linkend="usage-sync">.

	 You already know that when you are writing an email, you can
	 address it to one or more people, and that
	 <application>Evolution</application> will fill in addresses
	 from your address book's address cards if you let it.  In
	 addition to that, you can send email to everyone in a
	 particular group if you choose.

<!-- FIXME this feature not yet implemented 

      <para>
         You can also use the address book to print postal addresses
