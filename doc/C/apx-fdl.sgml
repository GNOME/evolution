	  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
	  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
	  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
	  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
	  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
	  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
	  modifications made by others.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
	  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
	  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
	  license designed for free software.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
	  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
	  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
	  software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
	  can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
	  whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
	  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

	  related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within

	  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
	  distribute translations of the <link

	  linkend="fdl-section4">section 4</link>. Replacing <link
	  linkend="fdl-invariant"> Invariant Sections</link> with translations
	  requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
	  include translations of some or all <link
	  linkend="fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</link> in addition to the
	  original versions of these <link linkend="fdl-invariant">Invariant
	  Sections</link>. You may include a translation of this License
	  provided that you also include the original English version of this
	  License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
	  original English version of this License, the original English version
	  will prevail.
