/**
 * e_mail_parser_extension_parse
 * @extension: an #EMailParserExtension
 * @parser: a #EMailParser
 * @mime_part: (allow-none) a #CamelMimePart to parse
 * @part_id: a #GString to which parser will append ID of the parsed part.
 * @cancellable: (allow-none) A #GCancellable
 * @out_mail_parts: a #GQueue to deposit #EMailPart instances
 *
 * A virtual function reimplemented in all mail parser extensions. The function
 * decodes and parses the @mime_part, appending one or more #EMailPart<!-- -->s
 * to the @out_mail_parts queue.
 *
 * When the function is unable to parse the @mime_part (either because it's
 * broken or because it is a different MIME type then the extension is
 * specialized for), the function will return %FALSE to indicate to the
 * #EMailParser that it should pick another extension.
 *
 * When the @mime_part contains for example multipart/mixed of one RFC822
 * message with an attachment and of one image, then parser must make sure
 * that parts are appeded to @out_mail_parts in the correct order.
 *
 * part1.rfc822.plain_text
 * part1.rfc822.attachment
 * part2.image
 *
 * Implementation of this function must be thread-safe.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if the @mime_part was handled (even if no
 *          #EMailPart<!-- -->s were added to @out_mail_parts), or
 *          %FALSE if the @mime_part was not handled
