/**
 * e_mail_formatter_extension_format
 * @extension: an #EMailFormatterExtension
 * @formatter: an #EMailFormatter
 * @context: an #EMailFormatterContext
 * @part: a #EMailPart to be formatter
 * @stream: a #GOutputStream to which the output should be written
 * @cancellable: (allow-none) a #GCancellable
 *
 * A virtual function reimplemented in all mail formatter extensions. The
 * function formats @part, generated HTML (or other format that can be
 * displayed to user) and writes it to the @stream.
 *
 * When the function is unable to format the @part (either because it's broken
 * or because it is a different mimetype then the extension is specialized
 * for), the function will return @FALSE indicating the #EMailFormatter, that
 * it should pick another extension.
 *
 * Implementation of this function must be thread-safe.
 *
 * Returns: Returns @TRUE when the @part was successfully formatted and
 * data were written to the @stream, @FALSE otherwise.
