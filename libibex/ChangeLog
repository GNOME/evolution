	gnome stuff.
	* testindex.c: Same here.
	* wordindexmem.c: Added <string.h> and <stdlib.h> to quench

2000-12-24  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Merge from camel-mt-branch.

2000-12-18  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* dumpindex.c (main): Same here.

	* testindex.c (main): Add a g_thread_init().  Sigh, glib's thread
	stuff is snot.
	(read_words): Setup another flat-out thread to test
	multithreadedness at little bit.

	* ibex_block.c (ibex_index_buffer): Add locking around internal
	calls.
	(ibex_open): Init the locking mutex.
	(ibex_close): Free the locking mutex.
	(ibex_unindex): 
	(ibex_find): 
	(ibex_find_name): 
	(ibex_contains_name): Add locking around internal calls.

2000-12-13  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* disktail.c (tail_compress):
	(tail_get): Added some casts to get rid of warnings.

	(ibex_diskarray_dump): Added a prototype.

	* ibex_block.c (ibex_index_buffer): Assigned cat the value 0 to
	start off with to avoid a warning.

2000-12-12  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* wordindex.c (cache_sanity): Made cache_sanity only be included
	if d(x) is defined as x.

	* wordindexmem.c: Made node_sanity and cache_sanity only be
	included if d(x) is defined as x or if MALLOC_CHECK is defined.
	Made sync_value only be included if d(x) is defined as x.

2000-11-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	there is no name there, we add it directly and dont look it up
	first.

	* testindex.c: Some performance testing & stat gathering stuff.

2000-11-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* wordindexmem.c (ibex_create_word_index_mem): Initialise nameinit
	& namecache.
	(contains_name): On first call, load all names into memory.  We
	usually do a whole lot of lookups in a row, and this saves a lot
	of penalties on a big list, for not too much a memory hit.
	(find_name): If we have the namelist in memory do a quick
	short-circuit check to see if we have to do further processing.
	(unindex_name): Cross check the namecache, if it is active.
	Remove it there too/or exit (no work to do).
	(word_flush): If we have the namecache active, destroy it now, as
	it is not needed anymore (for now).

2000-10-30  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* hash.c: #include <stdlib.h> to remove warning.

2000-10-25  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* ibex_internal.h (IBEX_VERSION): Bumped to another version.  The
	file format hasn't changed, but earlier bugs may create invalid

	(ibex_block_cache_open): As well.
	(ibex_block_get): And here too.
	(ibex_block_cache_sync): Sync the root block directly here.

	index_post.

	* .cvsignore: Shush

2000-10-24  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* block.c (ibex_block_cache_open): Create a word_index_mem for
	indexing the words, rather than a word_index.

	* ibex_block.c (ibex_index_buffer): If we haven't called index_pre
	yet, do it before indexing anything.
	(ibex_save): If wehave called index_pre previously, call
	index_post.
	(ibex_close): And same for here.

	* index.h: Added a cursor class, and cursor retrieval function for
	iterating through an index's keys.

	* wordindexmem.c (ibex_create_word_index_mem): New word class,
	similar to wordindex, but meant to be faster for updates.
	(word_index_pre): Implement.  We load all keys into memory.
	(word_index_post): Implement.  We sync and free all keys.
	(find): Remove lru code, its no longer a cache, but a lookup
	table.
	(add_index_cache): Remove lru code here too.
	(find_name): And here.
	(word_flush): Flush the hashtable direct.
	(word_close): Call flush to flush, rather than doing it ourselves.

	cache miss == a new word.
	(word_index_post): Maintain whether or not we are in an index
	state, and the depth of the state.
	(word_index_pre): Likewise.  Dont reread the index if we have
	already.
	(cache_sanity): Fixed for struct changes.

	* wordindex.h (IBEXWordClass): Added functions to prepare/cleanup
	for lots of indexing.  i.e. can be used to optimise indexing speed
	at the cost of extra memory usage during the indexing process.

	* dumpindex.c: Dumps the contents of indexs.

	* hash.c (ibex_hash_dump_rec): Also print the word count.
	(hash_cursor_create): Create a new cursor for iterating through a
	hashtable.
	(hash_cursor_close): 'close' the cursor. It is upto the
	application to close any cursors it creates.
	(hash_cursor_next): Goto the next key id.
	(hash_cursor_next_key): Goto the next key, reutrn the key.
	(hash_get_cursor): Return a cursor object.

	(word_close): And here too.
	(ibex_create_word_index): Double the size of the hashtables.
	(word_flush): Make sure we reset the wordcount to 0 if we remove
	the list items.  DOH.
	(add_index_cache): Use a slightly more sohpisticated aging
	algorithm to remove expired nodes.

2000-10-10  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* hash.c (hash_find):
	(hash_remove): 
	(hash_insert):  Truncate key if it is too big to fit in a
	single block to MAX_KEYLEN bytes.

2000-09-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* block.c (ibex_block_free): Make sure we map the 'free' block to
	a block number when unlinking a block (fixes a lot of assertion
	failures).
	(ibex_block_cache_open): Initialise sync flag on root block.  If
	it is not set on open then the index could be in an invalid state,
	and should be rescanned.
	(ibex_block_cache_sync): Sync root block last, and set the sync
	flag.
	(ibex_block_cache_open): Mirror root block flags in block_cache
	struct.
	(ibex_block_cache_sync): Likewise.
	(ibex_block_read): If we write a dirty block, then we clear the
	sync flag if its still set; we are no longer synced.

	* disktail.c (tail_get): If we use an empty tail node, then make
	sure we make it dirty.

2000-09-15  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* wordindex.c (word_close): Free hashtable on exit too.

	* disktail.c: Implemented tail-node storage for the end of long
	lists, or for short lists.  Should save significant disk space
	(5x?).
	Implemented special case for 1-item lists, where the tailnode
	pointer is used to store the index entry.

2000-09-14  Not Zed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* wordindex.c (add_index_key): Keys also handle tails.

	* block.c (add_key_mem): Initialise a memory based array for newly
	added index entries.

	limit, and then flush them to disk.
	(get_record): Merge in-memory records with disk records.
	(remove_record): Remove from memory first, and if that fails, goto
	disk.
	(find_record): Check memory first, then disk if that fails.
	(add_datum_list): oops, copy size * sizeof(blockid_t)
	(add_indexed): Make sure we link in the head node when we create a
	new one.

	* file.c, find.c: Fixed some warnings.

2000-05-11  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

2000-04-11  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* file.c (write_word): Always write out all words we have (even if
	its 0 ... the file expects it).  No longer check for removed files.	
	(store_word): Check for removed files here, and only add to the
	ordered tree if we have references left to this word.
	(ibex_write): First insert into the tree, to determine the
	wordcount to be saved in the output file, and then write that.
	(ibex_open): Remove some debug.

	* words.c (ibex_index_buffer): Always set 'unread', if it is a
	valid pointer (dont rely on caller to initialise it).

2000-03-26  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

2000-02-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (lookup_LDADD): For now. make a libibex.a library so
	we can link it with the camel provider.  I hate libtool

	* Makefile.am: automakify

2000-02-16  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>
