			A generic Messaging Library


                                   ----
				

Introduction:
-------------

Camel will be a generic messaging library. It will evntually support 
the standard messaging system for receiving and sending messages.
It aims at being the backend for the future gnome-mailer system.

The name "camel" stands for ... nothing. Open area of development there.
You know, that "bazaar" thing. Maybe could we organize a big contest on
gnome-list to find the best explanation :)

Camel draws heavily from JavaMail and the IMAP4rev1 RFC. People
wanting to hack on a provider should read the JavaMail API
specification, but CMC and MAPI are of interest too.

Please, before starting anything, wait for me to finish the abstract
classes. Some parts are not definitive yet.

 
Organization:
-------------

The library is roughly a set of abstract classes, some kind of generic
"interfaces" (idl interfaces, not java interfaces ).

Particular implementations are called providers.

Here are the basic objects:

* CamelService : an abstract class representing an access to a server.
Handles the connection and authentication to any server.

* CamelStore (CamelService): A hierarchy of folders on a server.

* CamelFolder : An object containing messages. A folder is always
associated with a store.

* CamelMessage : An object contained in folders. Is defined by a set
of attributes and a content. (Attributes include: the date it was
received, the sender address, .....)

* CamelTransport (CamelService): A way to send messages.
