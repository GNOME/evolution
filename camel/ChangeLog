	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_expunge_uids_online)
	(imap_expunge_uids_resyncing): Send a flag list rather than
	\Deleted by itself.  See #57381.

2004-04-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-folder.c (imap4_sync_changes): Don't
	bother doing any work if perm_flags is 0.

2004-04-21  Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	* providers/groupwise/Makefile.am: added CAMEL_LIBS to LIBADD

	the implementation to use address book returned form above call
	while creating e-sources

2004-04-21  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-folder.c (camel_nntp_folder_new): set
	the meta data file on nntp folders.

	* camel-disco-folder.c (disco_refresh_info_online): implement
	dummy virtual method.

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-folder.c
	(nntp_folder_refresh_info_online): implement.  Fixes #57280.

2004-04-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-folder.c (untagged_fetch): Fixed to
	not expect ]'s as part of the BODY atom token.

2004-04-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-vee-store.c (change_folder): (flags & 0) will never be
	true. Fixes bug #56982.

2004-04-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-utils.c: Changed imap_atom_specials[]
	to not treat ']' as an atom char (as per rfc3501). Fixes bug
	#50985.

2004-04-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c
	(imap_check_folder_still_extant): Use %F instead of %S so that the
	folder name gets properly converted from using '/' path delimeters
	to whatever the native character the server uses. Should fix bug
	#56715.

2004-04-14  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-disco-store.c (set_status): do offline mail syncing (only
	for open folders so far).  If we fail doing syncing or store sync,
	don't abort.

2004-04-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_online):
	Rearranged some error checking code to fix bug #56405.

2004-04-13  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.c (folder_getv): implement the new counts, and get
	them all atomically so they're only calculated once and can return
	consistent results.

	* camel-folder.h: Added CAMEL_FOLDER_DELETED, CAMEL_FOLDER_JUNKED,
	and CAMEL_FOLDER_VISIBLE args, to support client display of
	various values.

2004-04-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.h (camel_folder_delete_message): Fix NotZed's fix
	to not mark messages as unseen. Fixes bug #56879.

2004-04-13   Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-gw-listener.c
	(add_addressbook_sources): change the auth type string from
	Password to plain/password

2004-04-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fix for bug #56878.

	* camel-gpg-context.c (gpg_verify): Don't rely on the exit code of
	gpg, we already save enough state to decide if the sig is valid
	without it. Modified to only set BAD if gpg->validsig and
	gpg->nopubkey are both FALSE. If we get a NO_PUBKEY status
	message, then it simply means that the the sender could not be
	verified.
	(gpg_ctx_parse_status): Listen for NO_PUBKEY status messages.

2004-04-11  Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-gw-listener.c 
	(add_addressbook_sources) (modify_addressbook_sources) : add
	bookname to uri 

2004-04-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-provider.c: Fix capitalisation of the
	"mailcheck" section title and move it to the top (so it matches
	with the UI).

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_get_message): Fetch the
	entire message in one fell swoop even if the message size is
	larger than 5k *if* the message is a single part. Fixes bug #56686.

2004-04-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_online): Changed
	(!flags & _CREATE) to (!(flags & _CREATE))
	(get_folder_online): Do what create_folder() does and if the
	parent folder has \NoInferiors set but contains no messages,
	delete the parent folder and recreate it before creating the child
	folder. Fixes bug #56651.

2004-04-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.h (camel_folder_delete_message): always set the
	seen flag when we delete a message.  I demand that this may, or
	may not, fix #56549.

	* camel-folder.c: include camel-debug.h
	(camel_folder_set_message_flags): fixed the doco slightly (well
	reversed the flag and set explanation) and give an example.

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-folder.c
	(mbox_set_message_user_flag): message changed to folder_changed.
	(mbox_set_message_user_tag): ditto.

	* camel-vee-folder.c (camel_vee_folder_finalise): dont hook onto
	message_changed.
	(camel_vee_folder_add_folder): or unhook.
	(camel_vee_folder_remove_folder): "
	(message_changed): or proxy.

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_class_init): removed the
	message_changed event - its redundant, and covered by
	folder_changed, and just makes life difficult for everything using
	message_changed/folder_changed (and nothing uses it anyway).
	(message_changed): removed.
	(set_message_user_flag): emit a folder_changed event instead of
	message changed.
	(set_message_user_tag): "
	(set_message_flags): "

	* camel-object.h: revered the CAMEL_OBJECT_TYPE change, it should
	be a global variable access.

2004-04-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-folder.c: Added mutex locking where
	appropriate.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-store.c: Added mutex locking where
	appropriate.

	* camel-folder-summary.h (CAMEL_FOLDER_SUMMARY_TYPE): Defined.

	* camel-object.h (CAMEL_OBJECT_TYPE): Fixed.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-folder.c
	(camel_imap4_folder_utf7_name): Implemented.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info):
	Use camel_folder_info_build() to build the folder-info tree.

2004-04-06  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-debug.c: #if 0 out the sys/debugreg stuff.

	** See bug #56110.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (get_content): more debug!
	(get_content): if we have no content-type header set on a sub-part
	of a multipart/digest, then we need to set it to message/rfc822 as
	in the multipart/digest rfc (2046 or so?).

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_get_message): output this stuff as
	folder debug.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_get_message): add some
	imap:folder debug.
	(get_content): get xx.TEXT rather than xx if we're from a message
	parent part.

	** See bug #56464.

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_transfer_messages_to): do not lock
	the source here.
	(transfer_message_to): call the main entry point for get message
	and append message.

	** See bug #56050.

	* camel-vee-store.c (vee_delete_folder): delete the state file if
	it exists.

	* camel-object.c (camel_object_state_write): create the parent dir
	if we need to.  Also spit a warning if we fail in the end.

	* camel-vee-folder.c (camel_vee_folder_new): set the persistent
	state file location.
	(vee_sync): write the state file when we sync.

2004-04-05  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folders): dont add
	folders to folders_out here, only in get_folders_add_folders.

	* camel-store.c (camel_folder_info_build): simplify 'list append'
	since we have next pointer at the head of the struct.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (create_folder): fixed
	"containes" spelling count.
	(get_folder_online): "
	(get_folders_add_folders): duh, add the folder info to the
	folders_out array.

2004-04-02  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_get_deleted_message_count): New
	function to get the deleted message count (used for Outbox count
	which is total minus deleted).

2004-04-02  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-exception.c (w): turn this on, this should always be on,
	it points to real bugs in the code.

	* camel-folder-summary.c (summary_build_content_info): dont set
	attachments if its a signature block.
	(summary_build_content_info_message): same.

2004-04-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-exception.c (w): Wrap annoying exeption warnings with w().

2004-03-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_get_folder_info):
	Partially implemented.
	(imap4_get_folder): Implemented.

2004-03-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_decode_param): Use
	header_decode_text() rather than rfc2047_decode_word() to decode
	the brokenly rfc2047 encoded param value string in case it is
	actually made up of multiple rfc2047 encoded words. Thanks to
	Andrei Nigmatulin for the fix.

2004-03-30  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-store.c (camel_store_get_folder_info): added some debug to
	dump the whole folderinfo tree if store:folder_info is set.

	* providers/imapp/camel-imapp-driver.c: #if 0 out some code, to
	kill warnings.

	* camel-url-scanner.c: include ctype.h for isspace (wonder if it
	should use utf8 funcs?).

2004-03-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See #56146.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folders): check the
	top-level folders list for duplicates as well.
	(get_folders_add_folders): split out the folder return merging
	code from get_folders.  Absolute mess of crap to deal with more
	busted servers.

	* camel-debug.c (camel_debug_start, camel_debug_end): some helpers
	to wrap debug output for atomicicity.

2004-03-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-folder.c (camel_imap4_folder_new):
	Implemented.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-engine.c (engine_parse_namespace):
	If the namespace begins with "INBOX", canonicalise the INBOX
	portion (ie, make it all caps).

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_noop): Implemented.

2004-03-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_status): Updated
	to actually parse the STATUS response into a list of item/value
	pairs.
	(create_folder): Updated for above change.
	(get_folder_counts): Only call get_folder_status() once (we can
	get both values with a single call now). Fixes a FIXME and might
	also fix bug #55784.

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (get_folder_info): Removed
	debugging printfs.

	* providers/local/camel-local-folder.c
	(camel_local_folder_construct): Since the folder was *just*
	created, it shouldn't have any subfolders so set the
	CAMEL_FOLDER_NOCHILDREN flag (altho, ideally, we wouldn't be
	guessing these flags at all - rather we'd call get_folder_info()
	or some such). Fixes bug #56010.

2004-03-29  Radek Doulik  <rodo@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-filter-tohtml.c (html_convert): close pre tag in case
	we just flush. I am not sure if it's still worth to check for
	inlen == 0 and handle it specially, but didn't want to make too
	big changes.

	Fixes #55817

2004-03-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_counts): use
	object_bag_peek instead of _get, since we dont want to clash/wait
	for reservations.  More #56045 related fixes.
	(get_folder_counts): revert the lookup/hashtable stuff for the
	folder, and use object_bag_peek.

	* camel-object.c (camel_object_bag_peek): new method to get an
	object bag entry without worrying about if its reserved or not.

	* camel-gpg-context.c (gpg_verify): get the content-type off of
	the multipart-signed, not its container.  This seems wrong
	... but might fix #56084.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_counts): remove
	locking here, we're locked whne we enter.
	(fill_fi): call refresh_info unlocked.  More for #56045.

2004-03-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-folder.[c,h]: New source files
	implementing the CamelFolder class for the new IMAP4
	implementation.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-summary.[c,h]: New source files
	implementing the CamelFolderSummary class for the new IMAP4
	implementation.

2004-03-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_update_summary):
	Reverted imap.web.de fix.

2004-03-26  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-maildir-summary.c (flagbits[]): Added new
	maildir flags D for draft and commented P for forwarded.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_counts): Instead
	of looking up the folder in the object bag which will handle
	reservations and perhaps deadlock, just get the list of opened
	folders and use them if they're available.  Should fix #56045.

2004-03-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-engine.c
	(camel_imap_engine_parse_resp_code): No longer need to split ']'
	tokens from atom tokens due to a fixup in the ABNF grammar in
	rfc3501.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-specials.c: Changed ATOM_SPECIALS to
	include ']' (this is an addition in rfc3501).

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-store.[c,h]: New Store class for
	IMAP. Implemnted a bunch of but still got a ways to go.

2004-03-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_update_summary): If the
	server is imap.web.de, just ask for all the headers rather than
	"HEADER.FIELDS.NOT (RECEIVED)". Actually, maybe we should always
	just query for the entire header block?
	(imap_get_message): If the server is brain-damaged (that's a
	technical term), always fetch the message in whole, never bother
	to try and fetch partial messages (Courier-IMAP gives us the wrong
	BODY responses fairly often).

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (connect_to_server): Set
	store->braindamaged to TRUE if we find the string "Courier-IMAP"
	in the greeting.

2004-03-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fix for bug #55018.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (create_folder): Don't allow
	the user to create folders with #, %, * or the directory separator
	in the folder name (added the checks for %, * and #).
	(get_folder_online): Add a check to make sure the folder name is
	sane before sending a CREATE (ie. we want to allow getting of
	folders with discouraged characters in them if they exist, but we
	don't want to allow the user to create them).

2004-03-25  Martyn Russell  <ginxd@btopenworld.com>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-provider.c: Removed newline character
	from the provider description

2004-03-25  Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-groupwise-provider.c: removed ldap
	seetings and added a settng for SOAP port 

	* providers/groupwise/camel-gw-listner.h
	(add_calendar_tasks_sources, remove_calendar_tasks_sources),
	(modify_calendar_tasks_sources): read port number from url instead
	of hardcoding. Also removed code for adding e-sources for ldap
	address book and adding now e-sources for groupwise address book

2004-03-24  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-engine.c (camel_imap_engine_literal):
	New convenience wrapper function.
	(engine_parse_status): Fixed to handle literal mailbox strings.

	* providers/imap4/camel-imap-command.c (camel_imap_command_newv):
	Changed how %L works - create the CamelIMAPLiteral for our caller
	instead of expecting them to create it for us. We can autodetect
	what type of object (stream vs data-wrapper) the literal is, so
	it's trivial to do.

2004-03-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_get_message): Reworked
	the else bit to fix a bug where if we had the BODY structure, we simply
	wouldn't try fetching the actual message.

2004-03-23  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-exception.c (camel_exception_setv): use camel debug to add
	some debug here.

	* camel.c (camel_init): call camel_debug_init().

	* camel-debug.c (camel_debug_init, camel_debug): new util stuff
	for extended debug options.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_get_message): if we're
	supposed to be online, check we are online before proceeding.
	Actually major restructure so we re-try the fetch a couple of
	times first before failing.  i.e. silent reconnect.  See #55381.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_info_online):
	connect lock around this.  was getting a race with mem corruption
	otherwise.

2004-03-22  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c (camel_header_newsgroups_decode)
	(camel_header_newsgroups_free): decode newsgroups header into a
	list of newsgroups.

	** See #55887.

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-summary.c (camel_nntp_summary_check):
	NOOP if we're offline.

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-store.c (nntp_connected): spit a
	warning if we try to do stuff whilst offline, rather than crash.

2004-03-19  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-disco-store.c (disco_connect): ref the diary before
	replaying it.  it could get unreffed during replay if there's an
	error and we disconnect.

	* camel-store.c (camel_store_get_folder): no longer use
	folder_lock, we already have adequate serialisation code here or
	below here.  I hope.
	(camel_store_get_folder_info): same here.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.h: remove async_thread thing.

2004-03-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (imap_get_message): Checking
	that mi->content->type != NULL is no longer good enough to tell if
	a ContentInfo is complete (ie. contains the parsed BODY
	response). We need to check that th ContentInfo has children if
	the part is a multipart of message/rfc822 part. Apparently Zucchi
	didn't test his camel-folder-summary changes using IMAP.

2004-03-17  Radek Doulik  <rodo@ximian.com>

	* camel-folder-summary.h: use 1<<30 for CAMEL_MESSAGE_JUNK_LEARN,
	1<<17 was already used by imap provider and maybe others

2004-03-17  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-maildir-store.c: Reverted jeff's fix for
	#55018, since it wasn't tested, and doesn't work.  Wrote an
	alternate implementation, and tested it at least once.  Turns out
	it was a one line error, it still wasn't tested.  Oh well, its
	rewritten now.

	* See bug #55618.
	
	* camel-disco-diary.c (camel_disco_diary_new): seek to the end of
	the file after we open it.  c99 apparently says the file merely
	adds to the end of the file when you write, not that it is opened
	and positioned at the end of the file (linux's man pages are out
	of date).

	* camel-folder-summary.c (content_info_new): setup the content
	type as well, from the headers.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-summary.c
	(camel_imap_summary_add_offline): copy size from the source info.

2004-03-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.c (folder_rename): Always use '/' to derive the
	basename of the folder. folder->full_name is always the UNIX-path
	evrsion of the folder name, no matter what the actual path
	delimeter is on the underlying store.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_online): If the
	initial SELECT fails and CREATE is specified, clear the exception
	before attempting to CREATE, this way we don't have an exception
	set even if the CREATE passes. Fixes bug #55607.

2004-03-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (camel_mime_message_init): rever previous
	patch.  We don't want to set the default mime/type, it'll break
	stuff.

2004-03-15  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (delete_folder): same as
	below for path.

	* providers/local/camel-local-store.c (delete_folder): NULL out
	str before looking up the state file using it.  Otherwise we
	double-free str.

	* camel-mime-parser.c (folder_scan_skip_line): we want to scan
	till in-end-1.  If we've been called we're either at the end of
	data, or we know we have an end of line character within memory.
	Another case in Bug #53355.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (get_content, get_message):
	set the mime-type field on the content the same way as
	construct_from_stream does.  Bug #55472.

	* camel-mime-message.c (camel_mime_message_dump): utility function
	to dump message content to stdout.
	(camel_mime_message_init): default mime type to message/rfc822.

	* camel.c (camel_init): change camel verbose debug to be an int, a
	bitmask of debug options.

	* camel-mime-utils.c (camel_header_location_decode): drop embedded
	whitespace characters, and don't do unquoting, etc.  See rfc2557
	4.4.2 and rfc2017 3.1.

2004-03-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c (smtp_set_exception): Now
	takes an argument to specify whether disconnecting when respbuf is
	NULL is safe (to prevent us from recursively disconnecting or
	disconnecting during a connect).

2004-03-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fix for bug #53497.

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c (smtp_helo): Instead of
	unreffing the streams, call camel_service_disconnect().
	(smtp_mail): Same.
	(smtp_rcpt): Same.
	(smtp_data): Same.
	(smtp_send_to): Ignore exceptions for smtp_rset(). Also, check
	that we are connected before we try to send (in Evolution's
	current usage scenario, this isn't a problem but in the future if
	we ever try to fire off several messages via the same smtp

	too, so we properly encode the fragment.

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (get_folder_info): Use
	CamelURL to properly encode the fi->uri. Pass the CamelURL into
	scan_dir() so that scan_dir() can re-use it (rather than having to
	malloc/parse/free for each file/dir)
	(scan_dir): Use camel_url_to_string().

	* providers/local/camel-maildir-store.c (get_folder_info): Same as
	mbox.

	process it again
	(folder_changed): start filter thread if there's junk and/or
	nonjunk arrays

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (camel_imap_folder_new): The

	short_name, don't use imap_store->dir_sep as the dir sep, always
	use '/'. Fixes bug #53755 for the IMAP case.

	Fix for bug #53755 (local folders case)

	the cache, remove it from trash/junk, etc.
	(camel_store_unsubscribe_folder): changed similarly to

	processing anymore.

2004-02-03  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-object.c (camel_object_bag_add): null out the pair->func,

2004-02-03  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* tests/misc/url-scan.c: New test suite for url scanning.

	the end of urls. Also fixed to handle user@domain's

	not a url (like "Ewww.Gross") by check that pos[-1] is either an
	open brace or whitespace.
	(camel_url_addrspec_end): Don't allow toplevel domain addr-specs
	(if we encounter something that looks like it is a toplevel domain
	addr, it is more likely to be bogus than correct).

	Fixes for bug #53091.

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (create_folder): Set the new

	* camel-store.c (folder_info_clone_rec): Copy the flags too. Fixes
	the local folder case of bug #53091.

	as below.

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c (smtp_connect): Instead of
	using the form %s@%s in the password prompt, use %s on host %s,

	calls. Remember if we've already been called.

2004-01-30  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-store.c (camel_store_rename_folder): copy the old_name
	that comes in, since it might be the actual folder_name, which
	will go away during processing.  Related to #53123.

2004-01-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #53269.
	
	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-store.c
	(nntp_store_get_cached_folder_info): don't dereference last before
	checking if its null.

	* camel-object.c (camel_object_bag_rekey): added a doc comment.

	** See bug #53520.

	* camel-session.c (get_service): free the url once done, it now
	gets copied by the service.

	* camel-service.c (construct): copy the url that comes in, don't
	just '0Wn34z' it.  clena up exception handling too.

2004-01-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-object.c (cobject_state_write): output scan->name and
	scan->value for writing metadata, rather than meta->name/value
	which just duplicates the last entry, related to #53195.

	* camel-url.c (camel_url_free): zero out passwd/user/host before
	freeing them.

2004-01-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (rename_folder): Make sure
	the new dir path exists before trying to rename files to avoid
	ENOENT errors. Also save errno when we encounter errors so that we
	can report the true error later rather than an error we may get
	while reverting changes. Also, it is OK if the ibex files don't
	exist, so check for that errno case.

2004-01-28  Sivaih Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-gw-listener.c (account_changed)
	(modify_esources) : add port and /soap parts to relative uri while

	CAMEL_FOLDER_SUPRESS_JUNK_TEST flag instead of check_junk_for_imap

	* camel-folder.h (CAMEL_FOLDER_SUPRESS_JUNK_TEST): added new flag

2004-01-27  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #53373.

	* camel-store.c (camel_store_rename_folder): use object_bag_rekey

	removed the meaningless fixme, a butt-retrieved-number is as good
	as any in this case.
	(imap_get_message): revert peterw's change of 2002-07-15, instead
	of checking for online mode here, let get_message do it when you
	retrieve the parts.  This lets a multi-fetch (i.e. large) message
	work more betterer in offline mode.

2004-01-22  Jeremy Katz  <katzj@redhat.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c: Fix prototype to be consistent.

2004-01-21  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #52996.

	* camel-data-cache.c (camel_data_cache_add): put a do-loop around
	the object_bag_reserve stuff, otherwise we can add/abort out of
	sync (i.e. when object_bag_reserve returned a pointer we mustn't
	call add/abort).

	* camel-object.c (camel_object_bag_*): Added some inline doco.

2004-01-20  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #52817.

	* camel-session.c (camel_session_get_password): merged reprompt
	and secret into a flags field, and add more options.  Fixed all
	callers.

	keys from the same thread.  Oh the pain.

	* camel-vee-store.c (vee_get_folder_info): implement child flags
	properly. Changed to build tree itself rather than calling
	camel_folder_info_build.
	(vee_get_folder): if we're adding a folder with dummy parents,
	create and add the dummy parent folders too (as real folder
	objects).  We are the only owner of the ref, so this sort of leaks
	the folder, but they're small.

2004-01-14  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-groupwise-provider.c
	(camel_provider_module_init): missing renaming.

	printf.

	** See bug #52835.

	* camel-smime-context.c (sm_get_passwd): removed debugging.  If we
	get called multiple times in a row, then forget the old password
	and re-prompt - it was a bad password.  Zero out password memory
	too.

2004-01-13  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* providers/groupwise/camel-groupwise-provider.c: missing renaming.

2004-01-13  Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

	settings, password authentication, fix for check_equal where the
	protocols wouldn't be checked

	transfer encoding when setting up wrapper part.

	Added an encoding type parameter, set on data wrapper.

2004-01-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c (rfc2047_encode_word): if e_iconv() returns
	-1, check that errno != EINVAL - if errno *is* EINVAL, it just
	means that our convlen wasn't long enough to include the whole
	sequence. This is fine, we'll just start where we left off next
	loop thru. Fixes bug #52593 (the buffer was duplicated because
	state wasn't flushed).
	(camel_header_encode_string): Fixed a type-o in loop where
	encoding=0, don't g_string_append_len starting at 'word'
	inptr-start bytes long - 'word' could be NULL and/or inptr-start
	could be longer than inptr-word.

	* providers/groupwise/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): libcamelgroupwise.urls

	* camel-gpg-context.c (gpg_ctx_parse_status): Don't immediately
	prompt for a passwd after receiving the NEED_PASSPHRASE status
	message. Instead, parse the userid that gpg needs a passwd for and
	store it on our context. Wait for a GET_HIDDEN status message
	before prompting, this way if the user has their gpg configured to
	use gpg-agent, the user won't get 2 passwd prompts.
	(gpg_sign): Fixed to not free a gpg context that we have not
	allocated (could happen in a fail case).

2003-12-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (get_folder_info): Use
	CAMEL_FODLER_NOCHILDREN rather than NOINFERIORS because

	(camel_smime_context_describe_part): as above, and fix the logic.
	dont think its used anyway.  Bug #51750.

2003-12-10  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (libcamel_la_SOURCES): put the

	certvalidity.

	* camel-cipher-context.c (CamelCipherValidity): Added certinfo to

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_decode_rfc2184_param): Revert the

	** See bug #51899.

2003-12-09  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c (smtp_send_to): encode the
	address before sending it out, rather than using the raw/utf8

	local part of the address before outputting it.
	(cia_encode_addrspec): quote local part if need be.
	(camel_internet_address_encode_address): make folding optional
	based on whether inlen is null or not.

	the type functions.

2003-12-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-utils.c (imap_atom_specials): add } to

	* camel-filter-search.c (run_command): Don't set O_NONBLOCK on the
	pipe (1. we don't need to, and 2. we should have been setting
	O_NONBLOCK|prev_flags but we weren't, and so the pipe got
	O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK even tho we wanted to write to it).

	* camel-filter-driver.c (pipe_to_system): Same.

	FD_CLOEXEC on each fd rather than close()ing it. Apparently
	Linux's older pthread implementations use sockets and so this

	* camel-store.c (add_special_info): set SUBSCRIBED and NOINFERIORS
	flags to special folders, renamed method from

	header match.

2003-11-26  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-smime-context.c (sm_verify_cmsg): take a stream rather
	than a part for the content.

2003-11-26  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (libcamelinclude_HEADERS): conditionally compile
	s/mime support

2003-11-25  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-cipher-context.c (camel_cipher_validity_envelope): change

	* providers/local/camel-mbox-store.c (create_folder): Fixed an

2003-08-27  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/local/camel-local-folder.c (local_getv): implement
	PERSISTENT_PROPERTIES, for index mode.

	* camel-object.c (cobject_state_read): Also add property reading,
	and bump version to 1.
	(cobject_state_write): add persistent property writing.

2003-08-26  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-folder.c (folder_getv): chain up properly.

	* camel-file-utils.c (camel_file_util_savename): helper to create
	a .#filename filename.

	* providers/local/camel-local-folder.c
	(camel_local_folder_construct): init meta-data for local folders.
	(local_getv): chain up properly, if args are not processed, rather
	than don't if they aren't.

2003-08-23  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-object.c (cobject_class_init): added a new event,
	meta_changed.

	(camel_object_free_hooks): Free meta-data if it is set on the
	object.

	* providers/local/camel-local-folder.c
	(camel_local_folder_get_type): setup a property list for local
	folders, just 'index_body' at present.

2003-08-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-filter-driver.c (pipe_to_system): Added some more error
	checking for reading/writing to the pipes. Fixes bug #47880.

2003-08-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (decode_to_stream): Don't poke
	wrapper->stream directly, use camel_data_wrapper_write_to_stream()
	instead as this simplifies things and makes the imap data wrapper
	implementation Just Work (tm).

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-wrapper.c: changed prototype of
	write_to_stream() to return ssize_t.

2003-08-20  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-wrapper.c (imap_wrapper_hydrate): Make
	sure to ref the stream. Fixes bug #47749.

2003-08-18  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-http-stream.c: Various fixes to make it work.

	* tests/smime/pgp-mime.c (main): added missing 'ret' variable.

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c (connect_to_server): 
	* providers/imapp/camel-imapp-store.c (connect_to_server:
	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (connect_to_server):
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (connect_to_server):
	* camel-http-stream.c (http_connect): change service->session for
	tcp_stream_ssl_new.

	* camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c: Changed service to session, and fix some
	refcounting of it.
	include camel-operation.h

2003-08-15  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #47634.

	* tests/lib/messages.c (test_message_compare): check
	write_to_stream returns.
	(message_dump_rec): helper to dump message structure.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): dont set content
	encoding here.
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_parser): set it here
	instead, on every part.  basically same as setting the
	mime_type_field always.

	* camel-multipart-signed.c (camel_multipart_signed_class_init): 
	* camel-mime-message.c (camel_mime_message_class_init): 
	* camel-multipart.c (camel_multipart_class_init): override
	decode_to_stream to always do the same as write_to_stream, since
	we can never be encoded.

2003-08-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-wrapper.c (imap_wrapper_hydrate):
	Don't attach any filters to decode base64/qp/etc.

2003-08-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c (write_to_stream): Save errno when
	flushing/unreffing the filter stream.

2003-08-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c (write_to_stream): If the content is
	base64/qp/uu/etc encoded but the part is 7bit/8bit/(or otherwise
	non-encoded), set reencode to TRUE so that we decode the original
	content stream. Fixes a bug noticed on
	evolution-patches@ximian.com where a patch had a
	Content-Transfer-Encoding of 7bit but was base64 encoded.

2003-08-13  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-folder-summary.c (camel_folder_summary_remove_range): Fix
	the range check, we were stopping removal of 1 or 2 removals, for
	some odd and completely uncomprehensible reason.  Perhaps debug
	left in?

2003-08-13  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #47517.

	* camel-vee-folder.c (vee_sync): Always rebuild folder on any
	sync, not just expunge ones.

2003-08-11  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* providers/imapp/camel-imapp-store.c (imap_get_folder_info):
	force connect manually so basics work.

	** See bug #45505.

	* camel-service.c (camel_gethostbyname): duh, pthread_create
	returns the error code directly, not via errno.
	(camel_gethostbyaddr): Same, also properly handle the failure
	case.

2003-08-01  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #47208.

	* camel-filter-search.c (match_all): match-all with no arguments	
	should always return TRUE.

	* camel-folder-search.c (camel_folder_search_execute_expression):
	print a warning when we get an invalid result type & fixed a leak
	for that case.

2003-08-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* tests/message/test4.c: New test suite for the mime parser (which
	is where the below 2 fixes were noticed).

	* camel-mime-parser.c (folder_boundary_check): Calculate 'len' by
	subtracting the boundary start from inend rather than 'atleast'.
	(folder_scan_content): Calculate 'inend' differently depending on
	the EOF state.

2003-08-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-filter-tohtml.c (html_convert): Rather than checking
	*inptr == '\n', check inptr >= inend - this gets rid of an Invalid
	Read report from valgrind.

	* camel-mime-part.c (write_to_stream): Don't necessarily re-encode
	just because the encodings differ. Need to look into making it so
	that message/rfc822 and multipart parts ignore the
	Content-Transfer-Encoding header and just keep their 'encoding'
	bits set to DEFAULT.

2003-08-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (get_content): Updated.

	* camel-mime-message.c (camel_mime_message_init): Don't override
	the mime_type here.
	(process_header): Updated to use CamelDataWrapper's mime_type
	field.
	(find_best_encoding): Same.
	(best_encoding): Here too.

	* camel-digest-folder.c (camel_digest_folder_new): Updated for
	CamelMimePart::content_type change.

	* camel-mime-part.c (camel_mime_part_init): Override our parent
	class's default mime_type.
	(camel_mime_part_finalize): Don't need to unref the content_type
	anymore.
	(process_header): Updated to use CamelDataWrapper's mime_type
	field.
	(camel_mime_part_set_filename): Same.
	(camel_mime_part_get_filename): Same.
	(camel_mime_part_get_content_type): Same.
	(set_content_object): Here too.
	(write_to_stream): Updated.
	(construct_from_parser): Updated.

	* camel-mime-part.h: Remove the content_type field.

2003-07-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* tests/lib/messages.c (test_message_compare_content): If the
	chunks differ, perform a hexdump on the data being compared so
	that we may analyse it easier.

	* camel-multipart-signed.c (write_to_stream): Return ssize_t.

	* camel-mime-utils.h: Added the CamelMimePartEncodingType enum
	here.

	* camel-mime-part.h: Removed the CamelMimePartEncodingType enum
	from here.

	* camel-mime-part.c (write_to_stream): Updated to return
	ssize_t. Also minor changes to only re-encode the content stream
	if the charset or encoding changed (this way we write it out in
	the original raw form if nothing changed).

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Drastically
	simplify. We no longer scan html content to try and find the
	charset, nor do we care about converting the content to UTF-8 and
	handling broken windows charsets.

	* camel-mime-message.c (find_best_encoding): Use
	decode_to_stream() here. Also updated to not assume the content
	charset is UTF-8 since it is very likely not the case anymore
	since data-wrappers no longer are converted to UTF-8 at parse
	time.

	* camel-folder-summary.c (summary_build_content_info_message): Use
	decode_to_stream instead here too.

	* camel-folder-search.c (match_words_1message): Use
	decode_to_stream instead of write_to_stream so we can search the
	contents.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_init): Set the default
	encoding to DEFAULT.
	(write_to_stream): Updated to return ssize_t
	(camel_data_wrapper_decode_to_stream): New virtual function to
	decode a data wrapper to a stream (results in nearly identical
	behaviour to the old write_to_stream method).
	(decode_to_stream): Default implementation of above virtual
	method. Decodes base64/qp/etc streams.

	* camel-data-wrapper.h: Removed the rawtext bit and added an
	encoding member.

2003-08-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* tests/smime/pgp-mime.c: Same.

	* tests/smime/pgp.c: Updated to build and to import some custom
	gpg keys for use with testing.

2003-07-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (write_to_stream): Also updated.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (write_to_stream): This should return ssize_t

	* camel-multipart-signed.c (write_to_stream): Updated.

	* camel-multipart.c (write_to_stream): Same.

	* camel-mime-part.c (write_to_stream): Here too.

2003-07-11  Suresh Chandrasekharan <suresh.chandrasekharan@sun.com>

	* camel-iconv.c: Fix for #46168 'some additional locale aliases
	required for chinese support'.

2003-07-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_decode_word): Revert NotZed's fix for
	bug #42170 - this causes even more problems than it solves. See
	bug #46331 for info. Basically, each address header would be
	converted to UTF-8 twice which means no raw 8bit address header
	would render correctly.
	(header_decode_mailbox): Perform a sanity check on the resultant
	addr->str to make sure that it is valid UTF-8, if not convert it
	to UTF-8. Fixes bug #42170.

2003-07-23  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@ximian.com>

	* camel-provider.c (camel_provider_init): Print the provider
	directory as well, for debugging.

2003-07-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c: Revert previous changes.

	an (unsigned char *) to (char *) to fix a warning

2003-07-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (find_best_encoding): Updated to convert
	to/from the correct charset (since content is no longer
	necessarily in UTF-8).
	(best_encoding): Free the charset string when we're done with it.

	* camel-stream-fs.c (stream_read): Increment the seekable stream
	position by the number of bytes read. Oops.
	(stream_write): Same here.

2003-07-17  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>

	** See bug #42573
	
	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (do_append): Only free the
	response after we have finished the literal request, otherwise we
	could try processing folder updates incorrectly.

2003-07-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.h: Add the CamelMimePartEncodingType definition
	here.

	* camel-mime-part.h: Remove the CamelMimePartEncodingType
	definition.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Don't do any of the
	auto-detection we used to do here anymore. Just read the content
	into a memory buffer and record the encoding type.
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_parser): Don't mangle the
	Content-Type struct here anymore.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_init): Init encoding to
	DEFAULT.
	(write_to_stream): If the stream needs to be decoded, decode it.

2003-07-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-stream-fs.c (stream_read): If we read 0 bytes, then set
	eos to TRUE.

2003-07-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Get rid of the #ifdef ENABLE_THREADS since we no longer plan to

	cancelled, the message is floating, so free it.
	(struct _lookup_msg): Add a cancelled tag.
	(camel_gethostbyname, camel_gethostbyaddr): if we get a
	failure/cancel, cancel the lookup thread and detach, so we dont
	have to wait for it to return.  cleanup changed to handle the case
	where we didn't get a reply message.

2003-06-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (pop3_finalize): Made static
	(to match the prototype).

2003-06-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* camel-folder-thread.c (camel_folder_thread_messages_apply):
	don't leak the summary when reloading it.  Fixes a very large
	leak.

2003-06-17  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-vee-folder.c (vee_folder_remove_folder): Calculate ranges
	to remove folder info's more efficiently.  affects shutdown
	performance on big vfolders signifinantly.
	(vee_folder_build_folder): do the same here, when rebuilding a
	folder's definition.

	* camel-folder-summary.c (camel_folder_summary_remove_index): new
	function to drop a range of index entries in one hit.

2003-06-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #31745

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store-summary.c

	** See bug #44322
	
	* providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c (imap_command_strdup_vprintf):
	If we are outputting a folder name, make sure we calculate buffer
	size based on the raw/utf7 version

	** See bug #44121
	
	* camel-multipart-signed.c (signed_get_part): If we can't parse
	the content, but we have a stream, just use that as the content.

2003-06-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fix for bug #40788.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-engine.c (camel_pop3_engine_new): Now
	takes a flags argument. Currently there is only 1 flag which can
	be used to disable Pop3 server extensions.
	(get_capabilities): Don't check for Pop3 server extensions if the
	DISABLE_EXTENSIONS flag is set on the engine.
	(camel_pop3_engine_iterate): If we get a response that is neither
	+OK nor -ERR, default to treating it like a -ERR.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (connect_to_server): Check for
	the disable_extensions param.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-provider.c: Define a checkbox to
	disable all POP3 extension support.

2003-06-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Partial fix for bug #44457.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Make sure to set
	rawtext to FALSE if we successfully convert the text to UTF-8.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_init): Default the
	value of rawtext to TRUE instead of FALSE. This way if the mailer
	decides to try displaying a non-textual part as text, it knows
	that it needs to convert the content to UTF-8.

2003-06-04  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-uid-cache.c (camel_uid_cache_new): Create the directory
	with mode 0777 and the cache file itself with mode 0666. Let the
	user's umask filter the permissions. Instead of saving the fd on
	the Cache object, instead save the filename. Use camel_read()
	instead of expecting read() to just always work without getting an
	EINTR/etc.
	(maybe_write_uid): Don't do anything if cache->fd == -1, this
	means an error has occured in a previous callback. Replace the 2
	calls to write() with camel_write() and check their return
	values. If either of them fails, set cache->fd to -1 (GHashTable
	doesn't give us a way to abort foreach'ing thru the table).
	(camel_uid_cache_save): Save to a temp file instead of overwriting
	the original. Do proper error checking, etc. Also added some
	smarts about whether to try and overwrite the old cache even if we
	haven't successfully saved all the uids in the cache.
	(camel_uid_cache_destroy): Free the cache->filename, no longer
	need to close (cache->fd).

2003-06-11  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* camel-text-index.c (text_index_normalise): use g_utf8_strdown
	properly.

2003-06-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (find_best_encoding): Add the
	CAMEL_BESTENC_TEXT bit to enctype if the part is a text part.

	* camel-mime-filter-bestenc.c
	(camel_mime_filter_bestenc_get_best_encoding): If we have any
	nul-bytes or if the content is non-text and contains any 8bit
	octets, we need to use base64. Fixes bug #44344.
