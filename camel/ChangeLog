	definition.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Don't do any of the

	Content-Type struct here anymore.

	cancelled, the message is floating, so free it.
	(struct _lookup_msg): Add a cancelled tag.
	(camel_gethostbyname, camel_gethostbyaddr): if we get a
	failure/cancel, cancel the lookup thread and detach, so we dont
	have to wait for it to return.  cleanup changed to handle the case
	where we didn't get a reply message.

2003-06-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (pop3_finalize): Made static
	(to match the prototype).

2003-06-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

2003-06-17  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-vee-folder.c (vee_folder_remove_folder): Calculate ranges
	to remove folder info's more efficiently.  affects shutdown

	(vee_folder_build_folder): do the same here, when rebuilding a
	folder's definition.

	* camel-folder-summary.c (camel_folder_summary_remove_index): new

2003-06-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #31745

	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store-summary.c
	(camel_imap_store_summary_namespace_new): Workaround a shell bug -
	if the namespace has '#' in it, then strip it.

2003-06-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #44322
	
	* providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c (imap_command_strdup_vprintf):
	If we are outputting a folder name, make sure we calculate buffer
	size based on the raw/utf7 version

	** See bug #44121
	
	* camel-multipart-signed.c (signed_get_part): If we can't parse
	the content, but we have a stream, just use that as the content.

2003-06-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fix for bug #40788.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-engine.c (camel_pop3_engine_new): Now
	takes a flags argument. Currently there is only 1 flag which can
	be used to disable Pop3 server extensions.
	(get_capabilities): Don't check for Pop3 server extensions if the
	DISABLE_EXTENSIONS flag is set on the engine.
	(camel_pop3_engine_iterate): If we get a response that is neither
	+OK nor -ERR, default to treating it like a -ERR.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (connect_to_server): Check for
	the disable_extensions param.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-provider.c: Define a checkbox to
	disable all POP3 extension support.

2003-06-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Partial fix for bug #44457.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Make sure to set
	rawtext to FALSE if we successfully convert the text to UTF-8.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_init): Default the
	value of rawtext to TRUE instead of FALSE. This way if the mailer
	decides to try displaying a non-textual part as text, it knows
	that it needs to convert the content to UTF-8.

2003-06-04  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-uid-cache.c (camel_uid_cache_new): Create the directory
	with mode 0777 and the cache file itself with mode 0666. Let the
	user's umask filter the permissions. Instead of saving the fd on
	the Cache object, instead save the filename. Use camel_read()
	instead of expecting read() to just always work without getting an
	EINTR/etc.
	(maybe_write_uid): Don't do anything if cache->fd == -1, this
	means an error has occured in a previous callback. Replace the 2
	calls to write() with camel_write() and check their return
	values. If either of them fails, set cache->fd to -1 (GHashTable
	doesn't give us a way to abort foreach'ing thru the table).
	(camel_uid_cache_save): Save to a temp file instead of overwriting
	the original. Do proper error checking, etc. Also added some
	smarts about whether to try and overwrite the old cache even if we
	haven't successfully saved all the uids in the cache.
	(camel_uid_cache_destroy): Free the cache->filename, no longer
	need to close (cache->fd).

2003-06-11  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* camel-text-index.c (text_index_normalise): use g_utf8_strdown
	properly.

2003-06-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (find_best_encoding): Add the
	CAMEL_BESTENC_TEXT bit to enctype if the part is a text part.

	* camel-mime-filter-bestenc.c
	(camel_mime_filter_bestenc_get_best_encoding): If we have any
	nul-bytes or if the content is non-text and contains any 8bit
	octets, we need to use base64. Fixes bug #44344.
