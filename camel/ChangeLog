	* camel-medium.c (set_content_object): sink the content object
	after referencing it.

	* camel-mime-part.c: fix various little things in the handling
	of CamelMedium methods. Change camel_mime_part_set_text to the
	more generic camel_mime_part_set_content.

	* camel.h: sync to current reality

	* camel-folder-utils.[ch]: removed

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_format_date): fix format specifier
	for time zone. Fix typo in month names array.

2000-04-26  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-seekable-substream.c (stream_seek): Changed to have
	absolute seek semantics, not relative to the bounds.

	* camel-seekable-stream.c (reset): When we reset, seek to the
	start of the bound, if there is one.
	(stream_tell): Make tell virtual.

	* camel-stream-filter.c (do_available): Removed.

	* camel-stream-buffer.c: Remove leading _'s from static functions.
	(stream_read): Renamed from read().  Fancy that conflicting!  (my
	boo!)  Others too.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (get_message_by_number):
	Changed to stream_mem interface.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_uid): Fixed
	for streamfs interface changes, and implement a failure case.
	(_append_message): Changed for fs stream interface change.

	* camel-multipart.c (print_part): Iterate rahter than callback.  I
	hate glists's interface (hence, move this to write_to_stream).
	(write_to_stream): Return an error (yuck, this is a royal PITA to
	do with the stream write interface).

	* camel-mime-message.c: Removed leading _ from static names.

	* camel-mime-part.h: construct_from_parser() now returns an error
	code.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_parser): Changed to use a
	camel-data-wrapper instead of a camel-simple-data-wrapper (no
	change needed elsewhere?).
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Fixes for stream-mem
	interface changes.

	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.[ch],
	camel-simple-data-wrapper-stream.[ch],
	camel-stream-data-wrapper.[ch], removed.  Fixed including of these
	files.
	
	* camel-mime-part.c (camel_mime_part_set_text): Remove the use of
	the camel-simple-data-wrapper-stream, just use a mem stream.
	(write_to_stream): Renamed from my_*
	(construct_from_stream): Return an error on error.

	* camel-stream-mem.c (camel_stream_mem_new*): Remove mode
	parameter.

	* camel-stream-mem.h (enum CamelStreamMemMode): Removed.  It
	wasn't used at all.

	* camel-data-wrapper.h: Add camel_data_wrapper_new() to create
	these.
	(write_to_stream, construct_from_stream): Return an error
	indicator for success.  Fixed all methods to match (ICK).

	* Makefile.am (libcamel_la_SOURCES): Remove
	camel-simple-data-wrapper.c, camel-simple-data-wrapper-stream.c,
	camel-stream-data-wrapper.c.  Obsoleted by code re-use!

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (construct_from_stream): Change the default
	implementation to just set the output stream == construction
	stream.  Well, this lets me get rid of both simple-data-wrapper
	and stream-data-wrapper (unused anyway), and
	simple-data-wrapper-stream in one hit.  CamelDataWrapper is now
	also a concrete class.
	(write_to_stream): Use camel_stream_write_to_stream() to
	calculate/return values (and save code).
	Include <errno.h> for obvious reasons.

	* camel-stream.c (eos): Provide a default implementation of .eos().
	(camel_stream_write_to_stream): Make it return an error code on
	error.
	(camel_stream_printf): Changed to return the number of bytes
	written/error.
	(camel_stream_available): Removed.

	* camel-stream-fs.h (enum CamelStreamFsMode): Removed.  Changed to
	use unix modes and so forth (wasn't used for anything but new file
	creation and didn't work well either).

	* camel-stream-fs.c: Removed leading _'s for names.  And removed
	some virtual method 'documentation'.
	(destroy): Dont try and close a closed/error fd.  Only report
	error if close returns -1.  Moved all the code to finalise(), and
	killed this function.
	(init_with_fd): Properly setup the seek offset, if it is a
	valid and seekable file descriptor.
	(init_with_fd_and_bounds): Use off_t for bounds, set bounds on the
	seekable stream.
	(init_with_name): Return error codes.
	(init_with_name_and_bounds): Ditto.
	(camel_stream_fs_new_with_name): REturn NULL object if it failed.
	(camel_stream_fs_new_with_name_and_bounds): Return NULL object on
	failure.  Changed with_name* api's to take unix open style args
	and flags.
	(read): The bounded stream bounds checking seemed off, simplified
	code a bit.
	(write): Implement bounds checking for writing, the comment was
	wrong, it could make sense to bound writing.  Cleaned up a little.
	(available): Gone.
	(eos): Removed.  Use CamelStream's implementation now.
	(close): Reset the fd to -1, provide a warning for bad usage.
	(seek): Cleaned up.  Changed the behaviour a little, the returned
	offset is the absolute position in the file, even in bounded
	streams.	
	(seek): Seek from end mirrors lseek() behaviour (reverse seeking).

2000-04-25  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-stream-fs.h (struct _CamelStreamFs): Moved bounds and eof
	indicator to other parent classes.

	: Removed A bunch of gtk doc stuff for static (implementation) functions.
	(available): Removed.
	(write): Fixed the write implementation so that seek() works on a
	seekable memory stream, as expected.  Seeking past the end of the
	buffer has unix semantics (filling with 0).
	(available): Removed.
	(write): Implement seekable stream bounded stream.
	(read): Implement seekable stream bounded stream.
	(close): Dont free the stream_mem if we're not the owner.

	* camel-stream-mem.h (struct _CamelStreamMem): Changed position to off_t.
	(new_with_buffer): Changed len to be a size_t.
	(set_buffer, set_byte_array): New interface functions.
	(struct _CamelStreamMem): Removed position, it is stored in the
	superclass.

	* camel-stream.h: Removed some of the seemingly random
	whitespace.  Removed the available method (its not
	impelemented/useful enough).

	* camel-seekable-substream.c
	(init_with_seekable_stream_and_bounds): Remove the data_available
	stuff, it hasn't been properly implemented/finished, and may never
	work (unfortunately *sigh).
	(reemit_parent_signal): Removed part of the above change.
	(set_bounds): Removed (moved to seekable-stream).
	: Fixed up some of the generally unreadable indenting (sorry,
	wrapping at 80 characters with
	camels_really_long_function_names()
	just_doesnt_work_very_well_does_it().
	(available): Removed.
	(stream_seek): Fixup for object changes.  Make sure we return -1
	if the parent stream can't seek.

	* camel-seekable-stream.c (ccamel_seekable_stream_set_bounds): New
	function to bound any seekable stream.
	: Removed _'s.
	(camel_seekable_stream_class_init): Implement an init function, to
	setup the stream bounds to unbound.

	* camel-seekable-stream.h (CamelSeekableStreamClass): New virtual
	method set_bounds for seekable streams.
	(CAMEL_STREAM_UNBOUND): New define for no bound.

	* camel-seekable-substream.h (struct _CamelSeekableSubstream):
	Removed sup_bound and inf_bound, moved to CamelSeekableStream (and
	renamed, and changed to off_t's).
	(new_with_seekable_stream_and_bounds): Use off_t as the bounds.
	(CamelSeekableSubstreamClass): Uh, why was the intialiser virtual?
	Removed.

	* camel-seekable-stream.[ch] (CamelSeekableStreamClass): Changed seek
	to accept an off_t as the offset.
	(struct _CamelSeekableStream): Renamed cur_pos to position and
	changed it to an off_t type.
	(enum CamelStreamSeekPolicy): Set to match the SEEK_* constants
	from lseek().
	(get_current_position): Renamed to tell().

	* camel-stream-buffer.h: Commented out set_vbuf - never implemented.

2000-04-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-buffer.c (_eos): only return TRUE if the parent is
	at eos AND the buffer has been exhausted

	* camel-mime-message.c: fix some incorrect macro usage that
	resulted in bogus casts

2000-04-24  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): fix a cut-and-pasto.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_uid): ref
	(and sink) the message stream if we're going to unref it later.
	Otherwise it could get destroyed while there are still substreams
	attached to it. This needs a cleaner solution.

	* camel.h: remove data-wrapper-repository.h include(s)

2000-04-24  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-mime-message.c (construct_from_parser): Allow MESSAGE_END
	_or_ EOF as valid termination conditions.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c (message_struct_new): Decode
	and then re-encode the addresses, so they are consistently
	formatted.

	functions for working with the address thingies.
	(header_decode_domain): Free the string header, and dont expand
	'.' into ' . '.

	* camel.c (camel_init): No longer call
	data_wrapper_repository_init.

	* camel-medium.c (write_to_stream): Moved (back) to
	camel-mime-part.
	(add_header):
	(set_header):
	(remove_header): 
	(get_header): Make all these abstract, and spit warnings if
	called.  I guess it could manage the list, but well, it doesn't.

	* camel-medium.h (struct _CamelMedium): Dont store headers here,
	the implementor is the only one who knows their format.
	(CamelMediumClass): Changed header values to be void *'s.  They
	need not be strings?

	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.c (construct_from_stream): And we're
	back.  Set the output stream.
	(construct_from_parser): Moved to camel-mime-part-utils.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_parser): Create the

	camel-mime-part-utils.
	(separate_part): Removed.

	* camel-mime-part.c (construct_from_stream): Back again!  This now
	switches over to using a mime parser for any mime parts, only.
	(my_write_to_stream): Write our headers and so forth here.
	(add_header): Add header directly, parent class is abstract.
	(remove_header): Ditto.
	(set_header): Ditto.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_construct_from_stream):
	Remade abstract.
	(camel_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Moved to
	camel_mime_part.

	* camel-data-wrapper.h: Put back construct_from_stream.

	* camel-mime-part.h: Put construct_from_parser in here, the
	data-wrapper shouldn't know about mime.  Ok, so now to undo half
	of the last hours changes ... duh.
	
2000-04-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_to_decode, header_mime_decode): fix
	some obvious minor bugs noted by -Wall.

2000-04-23  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (get_message_by_number): Use
	construct_from_stream instead of set_input_stream().

	* camel-data-wrapper.h (CameldataWrapperClass): Removed
	construct_from_stream virtual method.
	Removed get/set input stream.

	* data-wrapper-repository.[ch]: Removed&from build.  Obsoleted?
	The justification as is follows: It is mixing storage
	protocol/format with message architecture.  It really just doesn't
	serve any purpose, as each medium implementor will have to have its
	own type->handler mapping, and the only current implementor,
	mimepart has a very simple structure and no need for this.

	* camel-medium.c (write_to_stream): Moved here from most of the
	stuff in camel-mime-part.  Well, the MEDIUM is the one that knows
	what the headers are, and the content is, let it write it out.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c (camel_mime_part_construct_content):
	Copied from camel-mime-part.c, removed handling of message
	followon state (moved to camel-mime-message).
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_parser): Renamed from
	construct_content.
	(camel_mime_part_construct_headers_from_stream):
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_stream):

	* camel-mime-message.c (construct_from_parser): Do
	construct_from_parser for mime-message.
	(_write_to_stream): Set the mime-version header for medium to
	write out, rather than writing it out ourselves.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (set_mime_type_field): Ref the
	content_field when we get it?
	(construct_from_stream): Removed.
	(camel_data_wrapper_construct_from_stream): Changed to a helper
	function, creates a mime_parser, and constructs from that.
	(set_input_stream): Removed.
	(camel_data_wrapper_set_input_stream): Removed.
	(get_input_stream): Removed.
	(camel_data_wrapper_get_input_stream): Removed.

	* camel-mime-parser.c (camel_mime_parser_unstep): New function.
	Cause a subsequent call to mime_parser_step() to return the same
	state over again.

	Initial test code using the mime parser to construct the message.
	(_get_message_by_uid): Use construct_from_stream() instead of
	creating our own parser.

	(camel_mime_part_construct_content): Removed to
	camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(my_get_output_stream): Removed.  The streeam is in the
	data-wrapper.
	(my_get_content_object): Removed.  The content object is stored in
	the medium.  If none is there, the object wasn't created properly.
	(my_write_content_to_stream): Removed.  The content object is the
	one that knows how to write itself out!!!!!!!!
	(my_write_to_stream): Remove the base header writing stuff - has
	been moved to camel-medium, where it belongs.  This can just be
	used to check for mandatory headers.
	(my_construct_from_stream): Removed.
	(my_set_input_stream): What the hell, i'll remove this too.
	Nobody seems to understand how it differs from create from stream,
	and they both seem to serve the same purpose ...

	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.c (construct_from_parser): Initial
	implementation of a content constructor.
	(construct_from_stream): Removed!  Job taken over by
	construct_from_parser.

	* camel-multipart.c (construct_from_parser): Multipart
	construction routine.
	(camel_multipart_init): Set the default multipart type to
	multipart/mixed.  Duh, no subtype is not allowed anyway.
	(set_input_stream): REmoved.  Replaced by construct_from_parser.

2000-04-22  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-multipart.[ch]: clean, document, etc.

	(_set_field): Removed, no longer used anywhere.
	(_get_field): Also removed.
	(_init_header_name_table): Add the Date header.

	Convert subject line to unicode, before storing in the summary.
	(strdup_trim): Removed, no longer needed.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_uid): Ref
	the folder after setting it in the new message.

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_content_object): Have the headers
	follow the content-type change here too.

	stored in the headers ...
	(my_write_to_stream): Use header_disposition_format() to format
	the content-disposition header.
	(my_write_to_stream): Removed old code, all headers are now stored
	in the camel-medium level, always.  Need to do the same with
	camel-mime-message i suppose ...

	not some weird function.

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_content_type_is): Handle empty types.
	(header_encode_string): Start of an implementation of the rfc2047

	references to it.

2000-04-20  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	functions rather than libc ones (since libc might not have them).
	(header_decode_date): add autoconfiscation on timezone code

	CamelSeekableStream, not CamelStream.

	* camel-seekable-substream.c: clean up a lot.
	(eos): When testing for end-of-stream, reset the parent position
	before testing if it is at end-of-stream, since either (a) it may
	have been seek'ed to eos by someone else, or (b) we may have been
	seek'ed away from eos and it hasn't been synced yet.

	* camel-medium.[ch] (camel_medium_add_header): const poison.
	(Belatedly goes with my change of 2000-02-23.)

	need to be fixed.

2000-04-17  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-message.[ch]: Remove the "session" field from
	CamelMimeMessage. Nothing uses it, about half of the existing
	calls to camel_mime_message_new_with_session pass NULL, and
	there's no obvious reason for it to be there.

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: #include <sys/param.h>
	for MAXHOSTNAMELEN. (This is a stopgap: some of the uses of
	MAXHOSTNAMELEN are wrong anyway...)

2000-04-07  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@stampede.org>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: fixes to numerous bugs;
	should now build fine.
	* providers/Makefile.am: Readded smtp now that smtp builds without

	Removed reference to set_name.
	(_set_name): Removed.

	(gmime_content_field_set_parameter): Likewise.
	(_print_parameter): Blow away.
	(gmime_content_field_write_to_stream): Get details from the

	(my_write_content_to_stream): Replaced camel-stream-b64 with the
	camel-stream-filter with an encoder.
	(my_get_content_object): Also implement quoted-printable decoding.
	(my_write_content_to_stream): Also implement quoted-printable
	encoding.
	(my_get_output_stream): Took out stream-b64 code (nothing's being
	executed yet anyway).

	* camel-mime-utils.h: Added offset for this header.  Records where
	it is in the source.

	* camel-mime-utils.c (header_raw_append_parse): Add offset
	parameter, to store where the header is stored in the stream.
	(header_raw_append): Added offset param.

2000-04-11  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-mime-utils.c: Moved a bunch of printf's to debug.

	* camel-mime-parser.c: Moved a bunch of printf's to debug.
	(folder_scan_header): Detect end of each header line using the

	* camel-mime-filter-charset.c (complete): Implement the completion
	function.

	* camel-mime-parser.c (folder_scan_step): If we get to the end of
	the body data, check any filters for outstanding completion data.
	(camel_mime_parser_scan_from): Set whether we scan for "From "
	headers or not.

	* camel-stream-filter.c (do_read): If we get to end of stream on
	the source, then call the filtering completion function to see if
	we have any more data to return.

2000-04-08  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	Close/Reset will have to provide the same args as filter, so it can
	flush remaining data *sigh*

	* camel-mime-utils.c (base64_encode_step): A rather complex base64
	encoder, fast?
	(base64_step_close): Companion function to finish off the base64

	bugs with error conditions.

	This has nothing to do with stream-b64, so i've moved it to
	CamelStream.

	header_content_type struct.

	* Makefile.am: Added camel-stream-filter*.[ch].

	* camel-stream-filter.[ch]: Class to implement a generic

	* camel-mime-filter.[ch]: A filtering class, which can filter streams
	of data without having to copy them.  Simpler than stream classes,
	and can be plugged into a single stream class (when i write it).

2000-04-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Clarify error
	messages.
	(finalize): fix a bug in camel_exception usage
	(pop3_connect): Remember the password after asking for it the
	first time.

2000-04-07  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added camel-mime-parser/camel-mime-utils.

	* camel-mime-parser.c: Fast mime parser.

	* camel-mime-utils.c: Mime utility functions, and email header
	parsers.

2000-04-07  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/Makefile.am: Removed smtp for now, its a long way from
	building.
	* providers/smtp/Makefile.in: Removed file that shouldn't have been
	checked in.

2000-04-06  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder-pt-proxy.c (_get_full_name): Remove exception param
	from get_full_name() called, since get_full_name() was changed to
	not have an exception in the last param (see dan's notes below).
	(_get_name): same.

2000-04-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-store.[ch]: Reorganize the folder-fetching methods and
	implement a folder cache so that multiple requests for the same
	folder will yield the same CamelFolder object (as long as it
	remains active). Includes some code to remove no-longer-active
	folders from the cache, but it doesn't get used since nothing is
	ever unref'ed in Camel right now...
	
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.c:
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: update for CamelStore
	changes.

	* camel-folder.[ch]: Remove the (unused) CamelException argument
	from camel_folder_get_name and camel_folder_get_full_name.
	(camel_folder_set_name): make this go away since changing a
	folder's name after it has been created could result in it
	conflicting with a separately-issued folder.
	
2000-04-05  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* g_url_new really wanted to take a CamelException. So, rename
	Gurl to CamelURL, g_url_* to camel_url_* (with camel_url_new
	taking an exception), and url-util.[ch] to camel-url.[ch]. Also
	force url->port to be numeric and remove camel_service_getport. (I
	was confused before: the URL RFC says the port must be numeric, so
	we don't want to do getportbyname.)

2000-04-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c
	(_check_get_or_maybe_generate_summary_file): Compare
	mbox_file_size and mbox_modtime to the results of stat()ing the
	mbox file, not the summary file. Duh.
	(_close): Update the summary's mbox_file_size and mbox_modtime
	before writing it to disk.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c (camel_mbox_summary_save,
	camel_mbox_summary_load): Wow. I must have been tired when I wrote
	this code. First, the comparison bug above. Second, it was using
	ntohs and htons instead of ntohl and htonl. Third, I was reading
	the status flag byte in two different places and thus getting out
	of sync. Fourth, it was writing out field_length bytes of each
	header field after having converted field_length to network byte
	order, resulting in lots of random crap being appended, and the
	summary files being huge. (Fortunately, since the size/modtime
	comparison was biffed, the garbage summary read from disk was
	always immediately discarded.)

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-parser.c (camel_mbox_parse_file): fix
	an off-by-one error that caused the last-used UID to be reused if
	the summary file was regenerated. (That one wasn't my fault. :-)

2000-03-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-mem.c: implement unimplemented methods

	* gmime-content-field.c
	(gmime_content_field_construct_from_string):
	* data-wrapper-repository.c
	(data_wrapper_repository_get_data_wrapper_type):
	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.c (my_write_to_stream):
	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_input_stream):
	remove debugging printf()s that no longer seem useful.

2000-03-31  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (text_to_html): Added "convert_newlines_to_br"
	boolean param, to give the option of not converting '\n's to <br>
	tags. This way, when we stick stuff in a <pre> tag, newlines stay
	newlines.

2000-03-30  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain): Use <pre> tag to force
	the use of monospaced fonts.

2000-03-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_getport): Add a htons in the
	default_number case, and document the fact that the function
	returns the port in network byte order.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Revert
	Miguel's change. The port number bug was actually somewhere
	else, and the IP address copying code was fine already.
	
2000-03-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Add htons
	(port), and only copy 4 bytes for the IP address to prevent a DNS
	attack. 

2000-03-28  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-seekable-substream.c
	(camel_seekable_substream_new_with_seekable_stream_and_bounds):
	make this return a CamelStream rather than a
	CamelSeekableSubstream, because that's the way Gtk objects tend to
	work.

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_gethost,
	camel_service_getport): convenience functions to canonicalize
	the host and port values of a service's URL.
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: use them

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c
	(_check_get_or_maybe_generate_summary_file): Make this work when
	the inbox file doesn't yet exist.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_append_message): uncomment
	the call to unlink the temp file: there's no way to tell
	camel_stream_fs to truncate a file, so reusing the same file was
	resulting in junk at the ends of messages.

	* camel-folder.[ch]: add delete_message_by_{number,uid}.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.[ch]: implement
	delete_message_by_uid. Add a close method to do expunging
	of deleted messages if requested.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.[ch]: support for
	CamelPop3Folder::close. (You have to close the connection
	in order to expunge the folder, thus the store may be
	connected in the CamelService::is_connected sense when it
	is not actually connected to the server.) Also some bugfixes.

2000-03-27  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_append_message): Unref the
	output_stream when done, close doesn't do it.
	(_append_message): Clear all uid's from the appending messages, so
	they are reassigned proper unique id's.

	* gmime-utils.c (get_header_array_from_stream): Actually free the
	header, it is copied elsewhere.

2000-03-26  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c (camel_mbox_write_xev): Added
	folder parameter to function.  Fixed callers.
	(index_message): Index a message as it is assigned a unique id.

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_content_id): Make sure we malloc and
	copy the content_id, otherwise *poof*

2000-03-25  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-medium.c (_finalize): Another leak, unref the content if
	finished with it.

	* camel-recipient.c (camel_recipient_table_free): Plug another
	memory leak - actually free the recipient table.

	* camel-mime-message.c (_finalize): Plugged a memory leak with the
	flags table.

	* gmime-utils.c (_store_header_pair_from_string): A simpler, more
	debuggable and functionally identical header extraction function.

2000-03-24  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* gmime-content-field.c (gmime_content_field_set_parameter):
	Remove the hash table entry before freeing its key and data.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add pop3.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: keep separate input and
	output streams so the output doesn't end up being buffered.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (get_message_by_number):
	finish implementing this.

2000-03-27  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_disposition): fix so less broken.
	(my_finalize): remove dodgy disposition free.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (my_set_mime_type_field): unref instead of
	free on mime_type.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_free_auth_types): new routine to
	free the data allocated by camel_service_query_auth_types.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (free_auth_types): implement

	* camel-stream-mem.c (camel_stream_mem_new_with_buffer): rename
	camel_stream_mem_new_with_buffer to ..._with_byte_array and add a
	new ..._with_buffer that takes a char * rather than a GByteArray.

	* Remove CamelStreamBufferedFs, since CamelStreamBuffer makes it
	redundant.

2000-03-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder-summary.[ch]: change the CamelFolderSummary
	interfaces to allow partial summary queries (for dealing
	with very large folders). Remove the "extended_fields" from
	CamelFolderInfo and CamelMessageInfo: this is better dealt
	with by subtyping.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.[ch]: Make CamelMboxSummary a
	subclass of CamelFolderSummary. Update interfaces for that. Remove
	the internal/external summary distinction. Remove the (unused) md5
	checksum in the folder summary. Change the summary file format
	(primarily to make it no longer byte-order dependent) and add a
	version number to it so it will be easier to change in the future.
	
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.[ch]
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c: update for summary changes

2000-03-23  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-provider.c: Added flag to provider
	initialisation, to match changed structure.

2000-03-22  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-folder.[ch]: Added async search api.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Changed to use an
	asynchronous interface.
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_cancel): Cancel function for async
	interface.

2000-03-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-buffer.c (camel_stream_buffer_read_line): Function
	to read one line of any size from a stream and return it in
	allocated memory.

2000-03-22  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	to query a service for the authentication protocols it supports.
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (query_auth_types): implement

	* camel-provider.c (camel_provider_scan): New function to
	scan the provider dir and return a list of all providers.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c: fill this in partially
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: make camel_pop3_command
	return the text after "+OK"/"-ERR" and add a separate
	camel_pop3_get_additional_data to get the message body or
	whatever. Also make them take a CamelPop3Store rather than
	a CamelStreamBuffer.

2000-03-22  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (debug): Disabled some useless debug
	messaging.

2000-03-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/pop3: some initial bits of the POP3 provider, to
	make Matt happy. Incomplete, untested, etc.

2000-03-21  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c 
	(camel_mbox_summary_append_internal_to_external): copy the size field

	message_info to NULL

	* camel-folder-summary.h: added the size field.

	in the return position.

2000-03-05  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	to the current position in the stream, not in its parent.

2000-03-04  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Ref the summary

	bonobo-goad-id is the good key to look for.

	(get_bonobo_tag_for_object): the correct syntax for the
	to set a parameter inside an <object> tag is :

	object output stream.

2000-03-01  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_stream): DO NOT assert on

	remove debug trace.

	utility function.

	implementation.

	revert strange changes. 

	* camel-stream-b64.c (my_read_decode): set eos to true when we
	have read the whole input stream. 
	(my_reset): set eos to FALSE.

2000-02-28  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c (_parse_header_pair): Dont free this either.

	* camel-medium.c (_remove_header): Ugh, dont free the header
	before we actually remove it.
	(_add_header): Ugh, dont free hashtable entries which may be
	duplicated (hash_insert _will_ reference that memory).

	* string-utils.c (string_trim): Trimming a 0-length string is not
	an error.

	* camel-mime-message.c (_parse_header_pair): Fixed very broken
	memory handling of header_name/value.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c (camel_mbox_write_xev):
	Initialise end_of_last_message always.
	(camel_mbox_copy_file_chunk): Stop trying to read if we run out of
	data, rather than looping forever.
	(camel_mbox_write_xev): Use an open flag when opening with create.

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_search_by_expression): No, its not
	a fatal error to search on a non-searchable folder, you just dont

	a bug, but what the hell ...)

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_init): Set search cap on.
	(_open): Call parent class to perform open.  Remove folder-open
	check to parent instead.
	(_create): open takes a creation mask, dont use umask to try and
	set the open mode.
	(_delete): Dont bother checking folder==NULL, its already been
	checked on the external interface (changed to an assertion, this
	would have to be a camel bug).
	(_delete_messages): Likewise.
	(_create): Ditto.
	(_init): Dont go and clear all the paths and shit that the parent
	open just setup for us.
	(_delete_messages): Get rid of more umask stuff.

2000-02-24  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder.c: use CamelExceptions for run-time errors, not
	incorrect code. Don't bother validating that an object exists from
	inside one of its methods, since you couldn't have gotten there if
	it didn't. Fix some code style bugs.

	(_init): Rename init_with_store to init and add parent_folder,
	separator, and name arguments.
	(_set_name): Get separator from self, not parent_store now.

	* camel-store.h:
	* camel-store.c: Remove get/set_separator.

	* providers/mbox/: Update for above.

2000-02-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	table.
	(_add_header): g_strdup the header name and value when adding it.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_headers_from_stream): Free the header
	data after calling camel_medium_add_header, since it will have
	g_strdup()ed it itself.

2000-02-22  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c: Dont compile by default.

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am: Fuck off the filter code.

2000-02-22  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel-stream-b64.c (read_decode__static): 
	don't read the char if we reached the length

	(camel_folder_create): 
	(camel_folder_delete): 
	(camel_folder_delete_messages):

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_create): 
	create the file and the path with two different
	names.

	* camel-folder.c (_create): handle the case 
	when the folder name starts with '/'

	* camel-exception.c (camel_exception_new): use

	Fix a bug in mail/message-list.c
	

	* camel-folder.h: cosmetic changes.

	* camel-stream-b64.c (reset__static): added a
	reset method. Thanks message-browser to find
	so much bugs :)

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am (libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD): readd
	Unicode libs.

2000-02-21  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel-formatter.c (lookup_unique_id): 
	awful hack to test get_output_stream.
	* camel-stream-b64.[ch] :
	b64 encoding/decoding is now implemented as
	a stream. 
	

2000-02-21  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel-seekable-substream.c (_reemit_parent_signal): 
	emit "data_available" when parent stream emits it. 


2000-02-21  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am: Uh, fixed LIBADD again.  What was
	there was never ever going to work, wasn't it tested?


2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-session.h: (struct _CamelSession): Add authenticator.

	* camel-session.c (camel_session_new): Add authenticator.
	(camel_session_query_authenticator): New function to query the
	session authenticator for password, etc, information.

2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-session.c: add CamelExceptions to several functions. Use
	camel_session_new to initialize the session and URL fields of
	created CamelStores as appropriate.

	* camel-store.h:
	* camel-store.c
	* camel-service.h:
	* camel-service.c: Move the session and url (and associated
	functions) from CamelStore to CamelService. Add url_flags to
	CamelService so subclasses can specify which URL components
	are mandatory for them.	Add camel_session_new for
	camel_session_get_store* to use.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.h: Update for above changes.

	* camel-exception-list.def: Once camel is being used for real,
	exceptions won't be renumberable. So renumber them now to make
	more room to add exceptions to the various categories later, and
	add a big warning message.

2000-02-20  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am: add libibex back to
	libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD

2000-02-18  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.h
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Added exception to call,
	and fixed caller.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Major changes, to use
	the sexp evaluator from filter/filter-sexp.c to implement the
	searching.
	(func_body_contains): Changed to support multiple strings in 1
	command (results or'd together)

	* url-util.c (g_url_new): Fixed a typo (colon == 0 isn't right),
	and made it so full url's are absolute pathed (Dan, this is how it
	has to work!).  Also, always include a path part, even if it is an
	empty string.

2000-02-18  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel/camel-types.h: New header with the typedefs for all camel
	classes. Now the class headers can just include this and the
	header for the parent type. This makes it possible for
	CamelService to include a CamelSession without creating an
	#include loop.

	* camel/*:	
	* composer/e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.h:
	* mail/folder-browser.c:
	* mail/message-list.c: frob #includes to match the new reality

	* camel/camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain): 
	(handle_text_html): use camel_stream_reset instead
	of seek. The formatter should be able to work 
	with all streams, not only seekable streams. 
	In the case where some provider implementation
	would not be able to provide a reset method 
	to their stream, implementors would have
	to find a workaround.

	* camel/camel-session.c (camel_session_new): use
	(void) instean of () in function decl.

	* camel/camel-folder.c: ifdef async operation 
	related code. 

	* camel/camel-seekable-stream.c (_seek): added a warning.
	(_reset): default implementation of reset for seekable
	stream.

	* camel/camel-mime-message.h: set_received_date declaration fix.
	cosmetic changes.

	* camel/providers/mbox/camel-mbox-provider.c (camel_provider_module_init): 
	use (void) instead of ().

	* camel/camel-stream.c (camel_stream_reset): 
	new method for CamelStream.

2000-02-17  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel/url-util.c (g_url_to_string): New function to convert
	a Gurl back into a char *.

2000-02-17  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain): 
	revamped so that it uses the output stream
