	* camel-data-wrapper.[ch]:
	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.[ch]:
	* camel-medium.[ch]: Clean, polish, document. Most of the gtk-doc
	comments added to camel-data-wrapper.c note serious problems that
	need to be fixed.

2000-04-17  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-message.[ch]: Remove the "session" field from
	CamelMimeMessage. Nothing uses it, about half of the existing
	calls to camel_mime_message_new_with_session pass NULL, and
	there's no obvious reason for it to be there.

	* providers/MH/camel-mh-folder.c:
	* providers/maildir/camel-maildir-folder.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c:
	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-folder.c:
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c: Use camel_mime_message_new
	instead of camel_mime_message_new_with_session.

	* camel-session.c (get_store_for_protocol_with_url): Set the
	exception if no provider is found.

	* camel-url.c: Add code to encode and decode %-escapes in URLs,
	and do some additional correctness-checking on URL syntax. From
	Tiago Antào with modifications by me.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* providers/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): add nntp

2000-04-14  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c: Fix switch statement.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-folder.c (_exists): always return TRUE
	for now.  we need to check the server response to make sure the
	group exists.
	(_get_message_by_uid): make sure to account for the \n we add to
	the string after every line.

	* providers/nntp/camel-nntp-utils.c (get_XOVER_headers): function
	to get the headers using the XOVER command.
	(get_HEAD_headers): function to get the headers using the HEAD
	command on each message. slooooooow.
	(camel_nntp_get_headers): make this function use either XOVER or HEAD
	versions depending on whether or not the server extension is present.

2000-04-14  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.[ch]: This didn't belong in Camel. Move to mail/

	* Makefile.am, camel-types.h: remove references to
	camel-formatter.

2000-04-12  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder-pt-proxy.c (_folder_open_cb): Print warning message
	for broken function.
	(_folder_close_cb): Same.

2000-04-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (pthread_SRC): Use correct names for the pthread
	source variables.

2000-04-10  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): fix various
	bugs in APOP code (still untested) and some of the error cases.

	* camel-provider.h: Clarify what provider.protocol, provider.name,
	and provider.description should be.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-provider.c: 
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-provider.c: 
	* providers/sendmail/camel-sendmail-provider.c: 
	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-provider.c: update protocols, names,
	and descriptions

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_number):
	implement get_message_by_number for the mail fetch code.

2000-04-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@stampede.org>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: reformatted to fit
	the standard indent format used by helix code

2000-04-09  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-movemail.c: New file with new function to dot-lock an mbox
	file and copy it to a safe private directory.

2000-04-08  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* providers/smtp/.cvsignore: Added a .cvsignore file.

2000-04-08  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/sendmail/camel-sendmail-transport.c (_send_internal):
	actually record the pid returned by fork(). Noticed by clahey.

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: #include <sys/param.h>
	for MAXHOSTNAMELEN. (This is a stopgap: some of the uses of
	MAXHOSTNAMELEN are wrong anyway...)

2000-04-07  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@stampede.org>

	* providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: fixes to numerous bugs;
	should now build fine.
	* providers/Makefile.am: Readded smtp now that smtp builds without
	error.

2000-04-07  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Clarify error
	messages.
	(finalize): fix a bug in camel_exception usage
	(pop3_connect): Remember the password after asking for it the
	first time.

2000-04-07  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/Makefile.am: Removed smtp for now, its a long way from
	building.
	* providers/smtp/Makefile.in: Removed file that shouldn't have been
	checked in.

2000-04-06  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder-pt-proxy.c (_get_full_name): Remove exception param
	from get_full_name() called, since get_full_name() was changed to
	not have an exception in the last param (see dan's notes below).
	(_get_name): same.

2000-04-06  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-store.[ch]: Reorganize the folder-fetching methods and
	implement a folder cache so that multiple requests for the same
	folder will yield the same CamelFolder object (as long as it
	remains active). Includes some code to remove no-longer-active
	folders from the cache, but it doesn't get used since nothing is
	ever unref'ed in Camel right now...
	
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.c:
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: update for CamelStore
	changes.

	* camel-folder.[ch]: Remove the (unused) CamelException argument
	from camel_folder_get_name and camel_folder_get_full_name.
	(camel_folder_set_name): make this go away since changing a
	folder's name after it has been created could result in it
	conflicting with a separately-issued folder.
	
2000-04-05  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* g_url_new really wanted to take a CamelException. So, rename
	Gurl to CamelURL, g_url_* to camel_url_* (with camel_url_new
	taking an exception), and url-util.[ch] to camel-url.[ch]. Also
	force url->port to be numeric and remove camel_service_getport. (I
	was confused before: the URL RFC says the port must be numeric, so
	we don't want to do getportbyname.)

2000-04-01  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c
	(_check_get_or_maybe_generate_summary_file): Compare
	mbox_file_size and mbox_modtime to the results of stat()ing the
	mbox file, not the summary file. Duh.
	(_close): Update the summary's mbox_file_size and mbox_modtime
	before writing it to disk.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c (camel_mbox_summary_save,
	camel_mbox_summary_load): Wow. I must have been tired when I wrote
	this code. First, the comparison bug above. Second, it was using
	ntohs and htons instead of ntohl and htonl. Third, I was reading
	the status flag byte in two different places and thus getting out
	of sync. Fourth, it was writing out field_length bytes of each
	header field after having converted field_length to network byte
	order, resulting in lots of random crap being appended, and the
	summary files being huge. (Fortunately, since the size/modtime
	comparison was biffed, the garbage summary read from disk was
	always immediately discarded.)

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-parser.c (camel_mbox_parse_file): fix
	an off-by-one error that caused the last-used UID to be reused if
	the summary file was regenerated. (That one wasn't my fault. :-)

2000-03-31  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-mem.c: implement unimplemented methods

	* gmime-content-field.c
	(gmime_content_field_construct_from_string):
	* data-wrapper-repository.c
	(data_wrapper_repository_get_data_wrapper_type):
	* camel-simple-data-wrapper.c (my_write_to_stream):
	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_input_stream):
	remove debugging printf()s that no longer seem useful.

2000-03-31  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (text_to_html): Added "convert_newlines_to_br"
	boolean param, to give the option of not converting '\n's to <br>
	tags. This way, when we stick stuff in a <pre> tag, newlines stay
	newlines.

2000-03-30  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain): Use <pre> tag to force
	the use of monospaced fonts.

2000-03-30  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_getport): Add a htons in the
	default_number case, and document the fact that the function
	returns the port in network byte order.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Revert
	Miguel's change. The port number bug was actually somewhere
	else, and the IP address copying code was fine already.
	
2000-03-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (pop3_connect): Add htons
	(port), and only copy 4 bytes for the IP address to prevent a DNS
	attack. 

2000-03-28  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-seekable-substream.c
	(camel_seekable_substream_new_with_seekable_stream_and_bounds):
	make this return a CamelStream rather than a
	CamelSeekableSubstream, because that's the way Gtk objects tend to
	work.

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_gethost,
	camel_service_getport): convenience functions to canonicalize
	the host and port values of a service's URL.
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: use them

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c
	(_check_get_or_maybe_generate_summary_file): Make this work when
	the inbox file doesn't yet exist.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_append_message): uncomment
	the call to unlink the temp file: there's no way to tell
	camel_stream_fs to truncate a file, so reusing the same file was
	resulting in junk at the ends of messages.

	* camel-folder.[ch]: add delete_message_by_{number,uid}.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.[ch]: implement
	delete_message_by_uid. Add a close method to do expunging
	of deleted messages if requested.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.[ch]: support for
	CamelPop3Folder::close. (You have to close the connection
	in order to expunge the folder, thus the store may be
	connected in the CamelService::is_connected sense when it
	is not actually connected to the server.) Also some bugfixes.

2000-03-27  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_append_message): Unref the
	output_stream when done, close doesn't do it.
	(_append_message): Clear all uid's from the appending messages, so
	they are reassigned proper unique id's.

	* gmime-utils.c (get_header_array_from_stream): Actually free the
	header, it is copied elsewhere.

2000-03-26  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c (camel_mbox_write_xev): Added
	folder parameter to function.  Fixed callers.
	(index_message): Index a message as it is assigned a unique id.

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_content_id): Make sure we malloc and
	copy the content_id, otherwise *poof*

2000-03-25  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-medium.c (_finalize): Another leak, unref the content if
	finished with it.

	* camel-recipient.c (camel_recipient_table_free): Plug another
	memory leak - actually free the recipient table.

	* camel-mime-message.c (_finalize): Plugged a memory leak with the
	flags table.

	* gmime-utils.c (_store_header_pair_from_string): A simpler, more
	debuggable and functionally identical header extraction function.

2000-03-24  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* gmime-content-field.c (gmime_content_field_set_parameter):
	Remove the hash table entry before freeing its key and data.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add pop3.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: keep separate input and
	output streams so the output doesn't end up being buffered.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (get_message_by_number):
	finish implementing this.

2000-03-27  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_set_disposition): fix so less broken.
	(my_finalize): remove dodgy disposition free.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (my_set_mime_type_field): unref instead of
	free on mime_type.

2000-03-27  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_free_auth_types): new routine to
	free the data allocated by camel_service_query_auth_types.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (free_auth_types): implement

	* camel-stream-mem.c (camel_stream_mem_new_with_buffer): rename
	camel_stream_mem_new_with_buffer to ..._with_byte_array and add a
	new ..._with_buffer that takes a char * rather than a GByteArray.

	* Remove CamelStreamBufferedFs, since CamelStreamBuffer makes it
	redundant.

2000-03-25  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder-summary.[ch]: change the CamelFolderSummary
	interfaces to allow partial summary queries (for dealing
	with very large folders). Remove the "extended_fields" from
	CamelFolderInfo and CamelMessageInfo: this is better dealt
	with by subtyping.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.[ch]: Make CamelMboxSummary a
	subclass of CamelFolderSummary. Update interfaces for that. Remove
	the internal/external summary distinction. Remove the (unused) md5
	checksum in the folder summary. Change the summary file format
	(primarily to make it no longer byte-order dependent) and add a
	version number to it so it will be easier to change in the future.
	
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.[ch]
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c: update for summary changes

	* camel-exception-list.def: add
	CAMEL_EXCEPTION_FOLDER_SUMMARY_INVALID
	
2000-03-23  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-provider.c: Added flag to provider
	initialisation, to match changed structure.

2000-03-22  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-folder.[ch]: Added async search api.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Changed to use an
	asynchronous interface.
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_cancel): Cancel function for async
	interface.

2000-03-23  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-buffer.c (camel_stream_buffer_read_line): Function
	to read one line of any size from a stream and return it in
	allocated memory.

2000-03-22  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-service.c (camel_service_query_auth_types): New function
	to query a service for the authentication protocols it supports.
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c (query_auth_types): implement

	* camel-provider.c (camel_provider_scan): New function to
	scan the provider dir and return a list of all providers.

	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c: fill this in partially
	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.c: make camel_pop3_command
	return the text after "+OK"/"-ERR" and add a separate
	camel_pop3_get_additional_data to get the message body or
	whatever. Also make them take a CamelPop3Store rather than
	a CamelStreamBuffer.

2000-03-22  Matt Loper  <matt@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (debug): Disabled some useless debug
	messaging.

2000-03-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/pop3: some initial bits of the POP3 provider, to
	make Matt happy. Incomplete, untested, etc.

2000-03-21  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c 
	(camel_mbox_summary_append_internal_to_external): copy the size field

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_uid): initialize 
	message_info to NULL

	* camel-folder-summary.h: added the size field.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.h: 
	added the received_date field.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c:
	documented all functions.

	* camel-folder-summary.h: name change and 
	new fields.

	in the return position.

2000-03-05  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* camel-session.h: cosmetic fixes.

	* camel-stream-fs.c (_read): 
	(_seek): fixed the current position so that it refers
	to the current position in the stream, not in its parent.

2000-03-04  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Ref the summary
	after we have got it.

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_write_content_to_stream): 
	stream the raw content instead of nothing if the encoding
	is not supported.

	* camel-stream-fs.c (_seek): handle eos more
	properly.

	* camel-formatter.c (get_bonobo_tag_for_object): 
	bonobo-goad-id is the good key to look for. 
	(get_bonobo_tag_for_object): close the <object> tag.
	(get_bonobo_tag_for_object): the correct syntax for the
	to set a parameter inside an <object> tag is :
	<object classid="..."> <param name="uid" value="..."> <param ...>
	</object>

2000-03-03  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_get_message_by_uid): 
	use set_input_stream instead of construct_from_stream
	to feed the message object. 

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (my_write_to_stream): reset output stream.
	(my_set_input_stream): unref the previous input stream.
	use the set_output_stream for default behaviour.
	(my_set_output_stream): unref previous output stream.

	* camel-mime-part.c (my_write_content_to_stream): reset content
	object output stream.

2000-03-03  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c (camel_mbox_write_xev): Make
	sure we open with create with a creation mask.

2000-03-01  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_stream): DO NOT assert on

2000-02-29  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* Makefile.am (libcamelinclude_HEADERS): Added camel-stream-buffer
	to build.

2000-03-03  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* camel-formatter.c (handle_image): in the case

	remove debug trace. 
	
	* camel-mime-part.c: Replaced all static functions
	with name begining with _ by the same name begining
	with "my_" to prevent the possible conflicts 
	with system symbols Dan warned us about. 
	
	* camel-stream-b64.c (camel_stream_b64_write_to_stream): 
	use CamelStreamB64 type for the input stream.

	* camel-mime-part.c (_get_content_object): remove 
	debugging trace
	(_write_content_to_stream): implement the b64 
	encoding the new way (that is using camel_stream_b64)

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (my_write_to_stream): 
	fix implementation so that it writes properly
	to the output stream even.

	* camel-stream-b64.c (camel_stream_b64_write_to_stream): 
	fix implementation. 

2000-02-29  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* camel-stream-b64.c (camel_stream_b64_write_to_stream): new
	utility function.

	* camel-mime-part.c (_parse_header_pair): Dont free this either.

	* camel-medium.c (_remove_header): Ugh, dont free the header
	before we actually remove it.
	(_add_header): Ugh, dont free hashtable entries which may be
	duplicated (hash_insert _will_ reference that memory).

	* string-utils.c (string_trim): Trimming a 0-length string is not
	an error.

	* camel-mime-message.c (_parse_header_pair): Fixed very broken
	memory handling of header_name/value.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-utils.c (camel_mbox_write_xev):
	Initialise end_of_last_message always.
	(camel_mbox_copy_file_chunk): Stop trying to read if we run out of
	data, rather than looping forever.
	(camel_mbox_write_xev): Use an open flag when opening with create.

	* camel-folder.c (camel_folder_search_by_expression): No, its not
	a fatal error to search on a non-searchable folder, you just dont
	get any matches.
	(_open): Dont open an opened folder (i dont see why this is really
	a bug, but what the hell ...)

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_init): Set search cap on.
	(_open): Call parent class to perform open.  Remove folder-open
	check to parent instead.
	(_create): open takes a creation mask, dont use umask to try and
	set the open mode.
	(_delete): Dont bother checking folder==NULL, its already been
	checked on the external interface (changed to an assertion, this
	would have to be a camel bug).
	(_delete_messages): Likewise.
	(_create): Ditto.

	* camel-stream-b64.c (my_read_encode): Fixed a typo.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c: Changed to use e-sexp,
	rather than filter-sexp.

2000-02-24  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-folder.c: use CamelExceptions for run-time errors, not
	incorrect code. Don't bother validating that an object exists from
	inside one of its methods, since you couldn't have gotten there if
	it didn't. Fix some code style bugs.

	(_init): Rename init_with_store to init and add parent_folder,
	separator, and name arguments.
	(_set_name): Get separator from self, not parent_store now.

	* camel-store.h:
	* camel-store.c: Remove get/set_separator.

	* providers/mbox/: Update for above.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(camel_mime_part_construct_headers_from_stream): Free the header

	(camel_folder_create): 
	(camel_folder_delete): 
	(camel_folder_delete_messages):

	Fix a bug in mail/message-list.c

	reset method. Thanks message-browser to find
	so much bugs :)

	Unicode libs.

2000-02-21  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel-formatter.c (lookup_unique_id): 
	awful hack to test get_output_stream.
	* camel-stream-b64.[ch] :

	emit "data_available" when parent stream emits it.

2000-02-21  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel-session.h: (struct _CamelSession): Add authenticator.

	* camel-session.c (camel_session_new): Add authenticator.

	camel_session_new to initialize the session and URL fields of
	created CamelStores as appropriate.

	* camel-store.h:
	* camel-store.c
	* camel-service.h:
	* camel-service.c: Move the session and url (and associated
	functions) from CamelStore to CamelService. Add url_flags to
	CamelService so subclasses can specify which URL components
	are mandatory for them.	Add camel_session_new for
	camel_session_get_store* to use.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.c:
	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.h: Update for above changes.

	* camel-exception-list.def: Once camel is being used for real,
	exceptions won't be renumberable. So renumber them now to make
	more room to add exceptions to the various categories later, and
	add a big warning message.

2000-02-20  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am: add libibex back to
	libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD

	command (results or'd together)

	and made it so full url's are absolute pathed (Dan, this is how it
	has to work!).  Also, always include a path part, even if it is an
	empty string.

2000-02-18  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel/camel-types.h: New header with the typedefs for all camel
	classes. Now the class headers can just include this and the
	header for the parent type. This makes it possible for
	CamelService to include a CamelSession without creating an
	#include loop.

	* camel/*:	
	* composer/e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.h:
	* mail/folder-browser.c:

	* camel/camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain): 
	(handle_text_html): use camel_stream_reset instead
	of seek. The formatter should be able to work 
	with all streams, not only seekable streams. 
	In the case where some provider implementation
	would not be able to provide a reset method 
	to their stream, implementors would have
	to find a workaround.

	* camel/camel-session.c (camel_session_new): use
	(void) instean of () in function decl.

	* camel/camel-folder.c: ifdef async operation

	use (void) instead of ().

	* camel/camel-stream.c (camel_stream_reset): 
	new method for CamelStream.

2000-02-17  Dan Winship  <danw@helixcode.com>

	* camel/url-util.c (g_url_to_string): New function to convert
	a Gurl back into a char *.

2000-02-17  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	* camel/camel-formatter.c (handle_text_plain):

	seek the begining of the substream.
	(_eos): fix eos condition testing. 
	(_finalize): unref parent stream
	(_init_with_seekable_stream_and_bounds): ref parent stream

	* camel/gstring-util.c (g_string_equal_for_hash): 
	(g_string_equal_for_glist): return type is int.

	* camel/camel.h: 
	* camel/camel.c (camel_init): use (void) 
	instead of ().
	
2000-02-16  NotZed  <NotZed@HelixCode.com>

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am (libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD): Added
	libfilter to link line (temporarily?).  Required for
	filter-sexp.

2000-02-15  bertrand  <bertrand@helixcode.com>

	* camel/camel-multipart.c (_localize_part): 
	this routine replaces the _read_part routine
	and does not store the part in a buffer. 
	(_set_input_stream): use the set_input_stream
	instead of the construct_from_stream.
	each bodypart is given an input stream. 

	* camel/camel-mime-part-utils.c: 
	include the data-wrapper-repository header. 
	(camel_mime_part_construct_content_from_stream): 
	use the set_input_stream instead of the 
	construct_from_stream method. 

	* camel/camel-seekable-substream.c (_set_bounds): 
	cur position is set to 0 not to inf_bound.

2000-02-15  bertrand  <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@aful.org>

	set the get/set_input/output_stream methods. 	

	* camel/camel-multipart.c (_construct_from_stream): 
	camel_stream_seek -> camel_seekable_stream_seek

2000-02-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* camel/providers/mbox/Makefile.am (libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD): Add
	the unicode libraries as well.

	* camel/camel-provider.c (camel_provider_register_as_module): Add
	error reporting here.  Desire to use Solaris increases.  Hair loss
	in the last two hours: 5,400.

	* camel/providers/mbox/camel-mbox-provider.c
	(camel_mbox_get_provider): Renamed function.

	* camel/camel.h: All include files use camel/ now here.
