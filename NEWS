Version 0.4, "Alewife", 2000-08-14
----------------------------------

Shell:

  - Added interfaces to display messages and a progress bar when the
    component is busy.  (Ettore)

  - Changed the shell BonoboUIHandler code to allow placing menu items
    such as "Print" in the right places.  (Ettore)

  - Added code to check if an existing `~/evolution' directory
    actually has the content we expect and, if not, complain to the
    user.  (Dan)

  - Fixed some Bonobo-related refcounting problems.  (Michael Meeks)

  - Removed the GConf dependency.  (JP)

  - Improved the API for the folder selection dialog.  (Ettore)

  - Memory leak fixes.  (Peter)

Calendar:

  The calendar is in the middle of major rewrite. Evolution 0.4
  ships with essentially the same calendar component as 0.3 did.

Addressbook:

  - More work on the Palm Pilot conduits.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Fixed some LDAP-related crashes.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Added support for displaying embedded vCards through a Bonobo
    component.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Added support for generic fields.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Fixed the navigation order for the Tab key in the contact editor
    window.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Fixed some Bonobo-related bugs and crashes.  (Chris Lahey, Michael
    Meeks)

  - Only display entries that have an email address in the address
    selector dialog.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Added an utility program to import vCards from Gnomecard.  (Chris
    Lahey)

Mailer:

 Generic

  - Long mailer operations (such as fetching new mail) now run
    asynchronously rather than blocking the UI. This involved
    a major rewrite of much of the Camel and mailer code.  (Peter)

  - GPG/PGP message decryption support (Nathan Thompson-Amato, Dan)

  - Unfinished messages in the composer can be saved to the "Drafts"
    folder and finished later.  (Jeff)

  - Double-clicking on a message in the message view now opens it in a
    separate window.  (Jeff)

  - vCards attached to messages now bring up a minicard view with a
    button to add the vCard to the addressbook (Chris Lahey, Dan)

  - Inline uuencoded/binhexed "attachment" support (Dan)

  - "Mark All Messages Seen" command.  (Cody Russell)

 Filters / VFolders

  - Major filter/vfolder dialog rewrite (Michael Zucchi) VFolders can
    now search any (searchable) folder, not just Inbox.

  - Auto-filter/auto-vfolder code (right click on a message in the
    list and pick one of the options at the bottom of the menu to
    create a filter/vfolder rule for similar messages).  (Michael)

  - You can now set the color of messages in the message list, based
    on filter rules.  (Local stores can also now store arbitrary user
    flags, although there is not yet UI code to set/view them.)
    (Michael)

  - Added "Save" button to the quicksearch bar to save a search as a
    vfolder.  (Michael)

 Configuration

  - Major mail config dialog rewrite (JP).

  - The mailer now remembers your threaded/unthreaded message view
    setting between sessions.  (Jeremy Wise).

  - Support for multiple identities (JP, Jeff), sources (JP, Peter), and
    IMAP servers (JP, Dan)

 Providers

  - You can now leave POP mail on the server. (This will [currently]
    only work right with POP servers that support the UIDL command.
    On other servers, it will never download some messages unless you
    never delete mail.)

  - There is now an MH-like local store available, and code to convert
    a folder from one type to the other.  (Michael)

  - The mbox provider now writes out "From " lines that are more
    compatible with other mailers (like Mutt) that are picky about
    their exact format.  (Michael)

  - The IMAP provider now supports searching (Jeff). Also various
    other speed/efficiency/robustness improvements (Jeff), and support
    for old IMAP4 servers as well as IMAP4rev1 (Jon K Hellan).


Version 0.3, "Jellyfish", 2000-07-21
------------------------------------

Shell:

  - Pop-up folder selection.  (Ettore)

  - Added support for multiple views.  (Ettore)

  - Added support for saving component-specific settings, and
    some initial code to save the view's configuration.
    (Ettore)

  - Fixed the Bonobo menu code so that it works with all the
    locales.  (Ettore)

Mailer:

   - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

   - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
    (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
    installed with emacs, the configure script will find
    that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
    (Dan)

  - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
    in the composer now.  (Ettore)

  - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
    problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can now
    also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

  - text/plain mail is now line-wrapped in the mail display,
    to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
    (Dan)

  - Allow user to specify IMAP namespace in the mail config
    dialog.  (Dan, Jeff)

  - Quoted-printable encoder fixes.  (Michael Zucchi)

  - Various NNTP fixes, include a news pane in the config
    dialog.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Some memory corruption fixes.  (Peter Williams)

  - Fix for message not being re-drawn as deleted.  (Peter
    Williams, Jeff)

  - Moving a message to another folder copies the flags now
    (Jeff)

  - Close signature in HTML mail with </PRE>, not <PRE>, and
    default to ~/.signature.  (Michael Meeks)

  - Fixed some confusing behavior in the message threading
    algorithm.  (Dan)

  - Improvements to the item selection code.  (Chris Lahey)

Calendar:

  - Added support for a bunch of previously unsupported iCalendar
    properties.  (Federico)

  - Conduit for synchronizing the calendar with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Seth)

  - ETable-based to-do list view ("taskpad"), for your viewing
    pleasure.

Addressbook:

  - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

  - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
    (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

  - Fixed some random crashes.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Implemented a vCard Bonobo control so that we can support
    inline vCard viewing in the mailer.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Quick search looks at both the name and the company name now.
    (Chris Lahey)

  - Added more functionality to the contact editor's toolbar.  (Chris
    Lahey)

Mailer:

  Major features:

  * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)

  * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)

  * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by Dan)


  Smaller features:

  * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)

  * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5 lines
    of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)

  * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
    multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)

  * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the envelope
    icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).

  * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).

  * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder selection

  * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and make the
    filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work with to or cc.
    (Dan)

  * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and jumps
    to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to next/previous
    unread message. (Dan)

  * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it correct
    or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the user exits (or
    chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)

  * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
    neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)

    the MIME type of attachments without useful type information
    (Dan)

  * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)

    headers. (Dan)

  * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)

    when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt when a rebuild
    isn't needed. Expunging should work reliably (Dan, Ettore,
    Jeff).

  * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).

  * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages over
    POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP bugs. (Dan)

  * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get dropped and
    small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)

  * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to correctly
    match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)

  * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
    Ettore)

  * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid corrupting
    the display). Make "get mail" always put unfiltered mail into
    Inbox rather than the current folder. (Dan)

  * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to subjects
    that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a default subject
    to forwarded messages. (Dan)

  * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
    directory it was in. (Dan)

    them... (Jeff)

  * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)

  * Make replies use the text/plain part of a multipart/alternative
    if the user configured plain text rather than HTML mail sending.
