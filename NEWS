--------------------------------------

There have been no verified sightings of this release.


Version 0.6, "Procompsognathus", 2000-10-19

General:

  - Split out lots of functionality to gal.  Evolution now depends on
    gal. (Chris Lahey, Gal Team)

Shell:

  - Added a cute splash screen.  (Ettore, TigerT)

  - Improved the way `~/evolution' is initialized the first time.
    (Iain)

    clicking on the scrollbar.  (Ettore)

  - Updated to use the new toolbar and UI merging code from Bonobo.
    (Michael Meeks, Ettore)

Mail:

  - Numerous i18n encoding, decoding, and display fixes. Non-ASCII
    text should be displayed correctly in most context in the mailer
    now. The composer no longer sends undeclared 8bit data. (Jeff)

  - The IMAP provider now caches summary info between sessions, so
    startup should be much faster for large folders. (Dan)

  - Subscribe/unsubscribe UI for newsgroups. (IMAP subscriptions will
    be supported in a later release.) NNTP authentication support.
    Various other NNTP fixes. (Chris Toshok)

    between sessions. (NotZed)

  - "Get Mail" now works for IMAP. IMAP mail no longer arrives
    asynchronously (although if you delete mail from another client,
    it will be deleted asynchronously). (Dan)

  - Image attachments now use thumbnail images rather than a generic
    image icon. (Iain)

  - Various IMAP provider bugs (Dan, Jeff)

  - Filter code cleanup/improvements. (NotZed) Filtering can read and

    the source folder, and don't filter deleted messages. (Jeff)
    Filters now log their actions. (Jeff)

  - Drafts, Outbox, and Sent folders now default to showing "To"
    instead of "From" in the header list. Messages output to the Sent
    folder are marked as "Seen". "Send later" on a reply will mark the
    message as having been replied to. (Jeff)

  - Message list "attachment" column is now functional. The
    read/unread state of a fake thread header now matches the state of
    the thread. (NotZed) Message list sorting is more clever (Jeff)

  - The "Print" toolbar button now opens a Print dialog rather than a
    Print Preview window. (Miguel)

    crashes while trying to move messages in the mailer. (Dan)

Addressbook:

  - Fixed a bug that would cause the addressbook to crash when
    embedded in the composer. (Dan)

Version 0.5, "Salamander", 2000-09-13
-------------------------------------

    Ettore)

  - Added interfaces to change the string displayed in the tree view
    as the name of the folder.  (Ettore)

    interoperability with new calendaring programs.  (JP, Federico)

  - New ultra-cool date range selector, aka little calendar.  (Damon)

  - Plenty of internal refactoring.  (JP, Damon, Federico)

  - Pilot synch work, mostly on pcs infrastructure and some todo work (JP)
    <EXPERIMENTAL>

  - Pilot synch work, mostly on pcs infrastructure and some todo work (JP)
    <EXPERIMENTAL>

Addressbook:

  - New advanced search dialog.  (Michael Zucchi, Chris Lahey)

  - Added parsing of addresses.  (Jesse Pavel)

  - Converted most of addressbook to UTF8.  (Lauris)

Mailer:

    any message header, and can do regexp searches on the headers and
    body.  (Jeff)

  - A first draft of an automated mailing list recognizer
    has been added.  (It will need more/better rules.)  (Ettore)

  - Attachments are handled differently now.  All attachments always
    have an icon and a header, and you can right-click on the icon to
    view/hide, save, or launch an external viewer.  (Dan)

  - It is no longer necessary to quit and restart after adding a new
    IMAP server.  (Peter)

  - Lots of i18n/charset fixing.  (Lauris)

  - Shiny new toolbar icons.  (Tuomas)

  - Giant menu reorganization. Most message operations are now in the
    "Message" menu, and folder operations in the "Folder" menu.
    (Ettore, Dan, Peter)

  - "Mark as seen" timeout is now configurable. Mail view remembers
    the location of the message list/message display split.  (Richard
    Hult)

  - New filter category: "On-demand", for filters to be applied
    at arbitrary times rather than during mail incorporation.  (Peter)

  - POP/IMAP config pages allow you to specify a port... this may
    go away in a later release when we support ssl/ssh tunneling
    directly.  (Peter)

  - Reply To All will now remove your own addresses from the recipient
    lists.  (Jesse Pavel)

  - Folders are synced when you switch to another folder now.  (Dan)

  - An IMAP bug that caused all messages to be marked as read before
    they were read has been fixed.  (Dan)

  - The IMAP provider is now more robust about dealing with other
    concurrent IMAP clients.  (Jeff)

  - POP and IMAP are better about when they do and don't try to
    reconnect.  This was part of Camel operation cancellation support,
    which unfortunately didn't make it into 0.5.  (Peter)

  - Sent and Outbox folders are now functional.  You now have 2
    options when sending a message - "Send Now" which will send the
    message imediately and "Send Later" which will queue the message in
    Outbox for later sending.  When a message is successfully sent, it
    is copied to the Sent folder for your records.  (Jeff)

ETable:

  - ETree fixes.  (Chris Toshok)

  - Lots of small usability fixes.  (Chris Lahey)

    data and the table is grouped.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Improved table printing when grouped.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Converted most of ETable to UTF8.  (Lauris)

    actually has the content we expect and, if not, complain to the
    user.  (Dan)

  - Removed the GConf dependency.  (JP)

  - Improved the API for the folder selection dialog.  (Ettore)

    selector dialog.  (Chris Lahey)

  - Added an utility program to import vCards from Gnomecard.  (Chris
    Lahey)

Mailer:

 Generic

  - Long mailer operations (such as fetching new mail) now run
    asynchronously rather than blocking the UI. This involved
    a major rewrite of much of the Camel and mailer code.  (Peter)

  - Unfinished messages in the composer can be saved to the "Drafts"
    folder and finished later.  (Jeff)

    button to add the vCard to the addressbook (Chris Lahey, Dan)

  - Inline uuencoded/binhexed "attachment" support (Dan)

  - "Mark All Messages Seen" command.  (Cody Russell)

 Filters / VFolders

  - Major filter/vfolder dialog rewrite (Michael Zucchi) VFolders can
    now search any (searchable) folder, not just Inbox.

  - Auto-filter/auto-vfolder code (right click on a message in the
    list and pick one of the options at the bottom of the menu to
    create a filter/vfolder rule for similar messages).  (Michael)

  - You can now set the color of messages in the message list, based
    on filter rules.  (Local stores can also now store arbitrary user
    flags, although there is not yet UI code to set/view them.)
    (Michael)

  - Added "Save" button to the quicksearch bar to save a search as a
    vfolder.  (Michael)

 Configuration

  - Major mail config dialog rewrite (JP).

  - The mailer now remembers your threaded/unthreaded message view
    setting between sessions.  (Jeremy Wise).

  - Support for multiple identities (JP, Jeff), sources (JP, Peter), and
    IMAP servers (JP, Dan)

 Providers

  - You can now leave POP mail on the server. (This will [currently]
    only work right with POP servers that support the UIDL command.
    On other servers, it will never download some messages unless you
    never delete mail.)

  - There is now an MH-like local store available, and code to convert
    a folder from one type to the other.  (Michael)

  - The mbox provider now writes out "From " lines that are more
    compatible with other mailers (like Mutt) that are picky about
    their exact format.  (Michael)

  - The IMAP provider now supports searching (Jeff). Also various
    other speed/efficiency/robustness improvements (Jeff), and support
    for old IMAP4 servers as well as IMAP4rev1 (Jon K Hellan).

    locales.  (Ettore)

Mailer:

   - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

   - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
    (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
    installed with emacs, the configure script will find
    that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
    (Dan)

  - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
    in the composer now.  (Ettore)

  - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
    problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can now
    also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

    to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
    (Dan)

  * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by Dan)


  Smaller features:

  * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)

  * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5 lines
    of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)

  * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
    multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)

    to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to next/previous
    unread message. (Dan)

  * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it correct
    or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the user exits (or
    chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)

  * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since

    small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)

  * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to correctly
    match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)

  * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,

  * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to subjects
    that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a default subject
    to forwarded messages. (Dan)
