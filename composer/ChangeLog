2004-04-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (create_composer): Use the E_ICON_SIZE enums
	rather than specifying an absolute pixel size.

2004-04-19  Michael Terry  <mike@mterry.name>

	* e-msg-composer.c: Update the composer to use the icon theme via
	the EIconFactory object in e-util

2004-04-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.c (attach_to_multipart): Same idea
	here as with build_mesage(), don't convert th gconf charset
	setting to the iconv name before setting it on the mime part.

	* e-msg-composer.c (best_charset): Now returns a malloc'd string
	bufefr containing the charset that has NOT been converted to the
	iconv name. This is important in order to avoid using the iconv
	charset name which may or may not necessarily be the IANA blessed
	name.
	(composer_get_default_charset_setting): Changed to always return
	the actual value in the settings (eg. don't return the iconv
	name).
	(build_message): Updated for changes to best_charset(). Set the
	actual charset name as the charset param and then get the
	iconv_charset from that. Use iconv_charset everywhere else.
	(get_file_content): Updated for changes to
	get_default_charset_setting().
	(setup_ui): Same.

2004-04-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (get_file_content): To be on the safe side
	(even though the real bug behind bug #51924 can't happen here),
	protect against adding a NULL charset filter tot he filtered
	stream.

2004-04-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	EDestination.

	* e-msg-composer.c (destination_list_to_vector_sized): new

	consumer.

2004-04-07  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (sig_select_item): Reversed the logic for
	setting the signature menu to "None" (only set it to "None" if a
	signature *isn't* set, doh!)
	(prepare_signatures_menu): Removed. Combined with
	setup_signature_menu().

2004-04-06  Radek Doulik  <rodo@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (prepare_signatures_menu): added empty hbox so
	that we have 12pxs between account setting and signature setting
	(set_editor_text): added pad_signature parameter to tell if we
	want to pad signature with <BR> (used when creating new mail, in

	(handle_mailto, e_msg_composer_set_body_text)
	(e_msg_composer_set_body): Fixed callers for above change
	appropriately.

2004-01-29  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (e_msg_composer_new_with_type): reverted
	radek's patch below, it was already fixed (#53176).  Changed the
	init order though, set_editor_signature only sets the current one,
	it doen'st insert it.

	** See bug #53506.
	
	* e-msg-composer-hdrs.c (e_msg_composer_hdrs_set_post_to_list):
	use a GString to build the result.

	post_to string.

	* e-msg-composer.c (e_msg_composer_new_with_type): set body text
	after setting composer's signature, so that signature is shown

	Fixes #53367

2004-01-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See Bug #53176, probably fixes others too.

	* e-msg-composer.c (set_editor_text): When we set the text, always
	add the signature implictly.  Means we don't have to set it
	manually and break changing the file, or hit any races.
	(e_msg_composer_set_body_text): dont call show_sig_file here.

2004-01-14  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See Bug #20017.

	* e-msg-composer.c (create_composer): set the composer to

	e_msg_composer_new_with_type, only visibility info of headers if
	in the visible mask.

	* e-msg-composer.[ch]: replaced folder selection button by entry
	with selection button next to it, enabled multiple folder selection,
	made it possible to see both To and PostTo fields, disabled
	setting the "X-Evolution-PostTo" header.

2004-01-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (autosave_manager_query_load_orphans):

	(e_msg_composer_hdrs_set_post_to): #if 0 out for now.
	(e_msg_composer_hdrs_get_post_to): Likewise.

2003-12-02  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* e-msg-composer-hdrs.c (create_headers): #if 0 the "post to"
	stuff for now (it requires the global_shell_client and the
	evolution_folder_selector_button which we don't have anymore).

2003-11-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (build_message): switch from just checking

2003-10-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* evolution-composer.c (corba_recipientlist_to_destv): EDestination =>
	EABDestination, and e_destination => eab_destination.
	(impl_Composer_set_headers): same.

	* e-msg-composer.c (update_auto_recipients): EDestination =>
	EABDestination, and e_destination => eab_destination.
	(e_msg_composer_new_with_message): same.
	(add_recipients): same.
	(handle_mailto): same.

	e_destination => eab_destination.

2003-09-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (save): Don't blindly claim that the file
	exists and then ask the user if he/she would like to overwrite
	it. First check that the file even exists, if not - then we've got
	a different error. Fixes bug #48759.

	* e-msg-composer-select-file.c (e_msg_composer_select_file): Use
	the proper selector title, otherwise it says "Attach files" when
	we are trying to save a message.

	remove-attachment bug. [#48466]

2003-09-15  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer-hdrs.c (header_new_recipient): Make the entry
	non-focusable again.  The right fix for A11Y is to add
	accelerators.

2003-09-11  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.h (EMsgComposer): Added an entry_uic field for a

	line).

	* e-msg-composer.c (create_composer): Set autoactivate to true on
	the HTML control's BonoboControlFrame.
	(setup_ui): Create the composer->entry_uic.
	(destroy): Free the composer->entry_uic.
	(entry_verbs): New array of verbs for the non-control entries.
	Moved the Edit* verbs to here, as they should not be part of the
	main set.
	(composer_entry_focus_in_event_cb): Load
	evolution-composer-entries.xml here for the non-control entries' UI.
	(composer_entry_focus_out_event_cb): Remove the menu items.

2003-09-10  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* listener.c (impl_event): We want to use decode to stream for
	attachment parts.

2003-09-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (autosave_load_draft): ugh, direct linking to
	evolution-mail suckage.  Should these callbacks just be handled
	internally?
	(handle_multipart_encrypted, handle_multipart_signed)
	(handle_multipart_alternative, handle_multipart)
	(e_msg_composer_new_with_message): Use new em_utils stuff for
	message formatting.

	error message. Fixes bug #47413.

2003-08-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.c (update): This needs to use
	camel_data_wrapper_decode_to_stream() rather than
	write_to_stream(). Also simplify a bit - no sense looping to load
	the pixbuf data into the gdk-pixbuf loader 4K at a time when we
	have the whole thing in a memory buffer already. Once done, unref
	the stream instead of closing it so we don't leak.
	(attach_to_multipart): Use decode_to_stream().

	* e-msg-composer-attachment.c (e_msg_composer_attachment_new):
	Avoid constructing thwe data-wrapper from the stream twice for
	message/rfc822 parts.

	DnD data.  [#47131]

2003-07-28  Antonio Xu <antonio.xu@sun.com>

	* e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.c  (update): add
	gdk_pixbuf_loader_close to close pix buffer loading.  [#45908]

2003-07-25  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer.c (GNOME_GTKHTML_EDITOR_CONTROL_ID): require the
	new composer control version.

2003-07-17  Michel Daenzer  <michel@daenzer.net>

	* e-msg-composer.c (autosave_manager_query_load_orphans): Set
	default answer of dialog to 'yes' to try and prevent autosaved
	messages from getting lost accidentally.

2003-07-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.c (attach_to_multipart): Revert my
	previous changes here too.

	* e-msg-composer.c (build_message): Revert my previous changes.

2003-07-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* bad-icon.xpm: Remove this. It was only used by e-icon-list,
	which is no longer there.

	* composer-marshal.list: Likewise

	* Makefile.am: Update
