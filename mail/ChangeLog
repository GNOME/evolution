	* message-list.c (ml_tree_value_at): Don't display an unread icon
	for a parent message status if it has unread children but has been
	read itself. Instead, show that we have unread children by just
	making the message test bold (which it was already doing, so
	yay... this was easy). Fixes bug #42630.

2003-06-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #44609

	* mail-vfolder.c (vfolder_edit_rule): put the ok/cancel buttons in
	the stupid gnome 2 order.

	** See bug #33593

	* message-list.c (on_selection_changed_cmd): also listedn to
	selection changed events, since the etable api has changed.
	(get_selected_cb): helper for above.
	(message_list_construct): hook to selection change signal.

	* mail-callbacks.c (composer_send_queued_cb): Unref the composer
	to match the ref composer_send_cb();

	* message-browser.c (message_browser_message_list_built): We want
	to disconnect from the messagelist, not folderbrowser signal.

	* mail-format.c (format_mime_part): We only really want to use
	mail_identify_mime_part() if the content-type is
	application/octet-stream - any other type (if it doesn't have a
	handler) should just force the user to save to disk.
	(handle_text_plain): Only pay attention to format=flowed if the
	mime-type is text/plain (handle_text_plain is the generic text
	handler, so we might be processing parts that are not really
	text/plain, thus the format param may have different meaning for
	those other textual types).

	* mail-send-recv.c (free_folder_info): free the info structure as

	* mail-callbacks.c (invert_selection): Get rid of the if-focused
	code, that will always prevent the etree from getting the
	selection inverted because the menu item will always have focus at
	this time. Fix for bug #43972.

2003-06-11  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #22542

2003-06-04  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #43974

	* mail-tools.c (mail_tool_do_movemail): use a proper CamelURL to
	decode the uri, not hacky strcmp stuff.

	* mail-account-gui.c (extract_values): if we have an conf_entry,
	ignore username, hostname, and path ones, as these are handled
	implicitly in the url itself.  Came about because of the fix for
	#42838.

2003-06-03  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@ximian.com>

	* mail-search.c (mail_search_construct): Put the buttons in HIG

	add Escape as a keybinding for the Close button (see why GTK+ is
	on crack on b.g.o #74221 and #101293).
