	** See bug #47208.

	* filter-code.c (build_code): wrap the expression in a match-all
	so boolean expressions work properly for folder searches.

2003-07-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use EVO_MARSHAL_RULE

2003-06-13  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

2003-06-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	Fixes some leaks from bug #43883.

	* filter-file.c (xml_decode): Free file->path and set it to
	NULL before entering the loop to decode it. This way if the value
	is already set we don't leak it. Set file->path = g_strdup (str ?
	str : ""); and then xmlFree the str.

	* filter-source.c (filter_source_get_sources): Same as below.

	* filter-label.c (xml_create): Unref the gconf client when we're
	finished with it.
