	Fixes some leaks from bug #43883.

	* filter-file.c (xml_decode): Free file->path and set it to
	NULL before entering the loop to decode it. This way if the value
	is already set we don't leak it. Set file->path = g_strdup (str ?
	str : ""); and then xmlFree the str.

	* filter-source.c (filter_source_get_sources): Same as below.

	* filter-label.c (xml_create): Unref the gconf client when we're
	finished with it.
