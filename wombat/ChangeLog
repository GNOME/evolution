	of the old IMC backend.

2000-05-13  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): GNOME includes should come last, so that
	we are sure we pick our own includes instead of the installed
	ones, if any.

2000-05-10  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added an include for the pcs directory.

2000-05-08  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (setup_pcs): Register the "file" method with the IMC
	backend.

2000-05-05  Chris Toshok <toshok@helixcode.com>
	* .cvsignore: ignore wombat.pure

	* Makefile.am: add support for building wombat.pure

2000-05-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (main): Doh, also unref the pas_book_factory when we
	are done.

2000-04-30  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (setup_pas): Connect to the "last_book_gone" signal of
	the book factory.
	(last_book_gone_cb): Handle the "last_book_gone" signal.
	(termination_handler): Check if the book factory has zero running
	backends.

2000-04-30  Christopher James Lahey  <clahey@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added ename libs to LDADD. 

2000-04-27  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c
	(register_pcs): New function for registering into the name
	service.  Varies according on whether we are `USING_OAF' or not.
	(init_corba): New function for initializing the CORBA stuff.
	Implementation depends on `USING_OAF'.
	(init_bonobo): Use `init_corba'.

	* Makefile.am: Updated for OAF.

2000-04-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (cal_factory pas_book_factory): New module-wide
	variables for the PAS and PCS factories.
	(setup_pcs): Connect to the "last_calendar_gone" signal of the
	calendar factory.
	(last_calendar_gone_cb): Queue a termination job.
	(queue_termination): Function to queue a termination job.  We have
	to use a timeout to reduce the probability of running into GOAD's
	race condition with factories.
	(termination_handler): Check that the PCS and the PAS have zero
	backends.  If so, exit the main loop.
	(setup_vfs): Use EXIT_FAILURE instead of 1.
	(init_bonobo): Likewise.
	(main): Destroy the factories and exit Wombat.  Wheee!

2000-04-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Removed spurious calendar directories
	from the include path.  Added "wombat" log domain for glib.
	(wombat_LDADD): Link libpcs.a instead of the old shared library.

	* wombat.c: cal-factory.h is an internal include file.  * wombat.c
	(setup_pcs): We should NOT share a CORBA_environment across all
	functions!  Use our own CORBA_environment.
	(init_bonobo): Use our own CORBA_environment.  Free the exception
	after initializing GOAD, and present some error messages if
	necessary.  (Should g_message()s for exceptional situations be
	marked for translation?).

2000-04-15  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added
	`-I$(top_builddir)/addressbook/backend/pas', and
	`-I$(top_builddir)/calendar/pcs' because that's where the
	IDL-generated files go.

2000-04-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (wombat_LDADD): use BONOBO_VFS_GNOME_LIBS instead of
	BONOBO_HTML_GNOME_LIBS.  fixes freebsd's problem running wombat.

2000-04-14  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* wombat.c (setup_pcs): Must pass "object" for the kind to
	goad_server_register(); "server" is meaningless.
	(setup_pcs): Do not free the CORBA environment more than once.
	Also, fix error messages.

	* wombat.gnorba: The GOAD ID is "evolution:calendar-factory", not
	"evolution:calendar-server".

	* ChangeLog: Started the ChangeLog for Wombat.
