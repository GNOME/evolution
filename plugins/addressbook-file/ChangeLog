	* addressbook-file.c (e_book_file_dummy): fix relative_uri type,
	don't include every header in the world we dont' need.  And it
	sure has hell seems to do something for a 'dummy' function.

	* Makefile.am: There is no EVOLUTION_CFLAGS. Use
	NO_UNDEFINED. Link with EVOLUTION_ADDRESSBOOK_LIBS.

	* addressbook-file.c (e_book_file_dummy) :

	part of fix for #73152
