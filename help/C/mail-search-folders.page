  <title>Using Search folders</title>
  
<p>If <link xref="mail-filters">filters</link> are not flexible enough, or you find yourself performing the same <link xref="mail-searching">search</link> again and again, consider a search folder.</p>

<p>A search folder looks like a <link xref="mail-folders">folder</link>, it acts like a <link xref="mail-searching">search</link>, and you set it up like a <link xref="mail-filters">filter</link>. While a conventional folder actually contains messages, a search folder is a view of messages that might be in several different folders. The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria that you have chosen when setting up the search folder.</p>

<note style="tip"><p>In the unlikely case that there is no <gui>Search folders</gui> top-level node displayed at the bottom of the <link xref="intro-main-window#e-mail">mail folder list</link> you have to enable <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui><gui>Mail Accounts</gui><gui>Search Folders</gui></guiseq>.</p></note>

<p><app>Evolution</app> automatically updates the search folder contents when new messages are received or message are deleted.</p>

<p>The <gui>Unmatched</gui> search folder is the opposite of other search folders: it displays all messages that do not appear in other search folders.</p>

<p>If you use remote email storage like IMAP, and have created search folders to search through them, the <gui>Unmatched</gui> search folder also searches the remote folders. If you do not create any search folders that search remote mail stores, the <gui>Unmatched</gui> search folder does not search in them either.</p>
