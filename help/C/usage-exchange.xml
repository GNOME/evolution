    <title>The Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
    <para>The Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Novell
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available through Novell Red Carpet in its own
    channel. Like Novell Evolution, it is free software and licensed under the
    GPL.
  </para>
   
  <warning id="licensing">
    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Evolution Connector works only with Exchange 2000 and later, and requires
      that Outlook Web Access be enabled. Each user will need a
      valid Microsoft Exchange server account, including license.

    <para>
      Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for
      Exchange accounts is stored on the
      server, not on your desktop computer.  This means that you can
      access it from multiple locations. It also means that your
      Microsoft Exchange account information
      is in a separate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
      tree in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree,
      with the name you gave the account. If you have multiple
      accounts, you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
      Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
      have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
      cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
      are items in your local calendar or address book that you'd like
      to add to your Exchange stores, you
      can copy and paste them over, or just drag items from one folder
      to another as you would with two local stores.

          If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail
          account, you should be aware that whenever you save an email
          address or appointment from an email message, it will be
          saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar, rather
          than in your local account. The same is true of
          synchronization with Palm-OS devices: tasks, appointments,
          and addresses from your Palm-OS device will be synchronized
          with those in the Exchange folders rather than local
          folders.
