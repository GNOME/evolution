    To begin using the calendar, select
    <guibutton>Calendar</guibutton> from the <interface>shortcut
    bar</interface>.  By default, the calendar starts showing today's
    schedule on a ruled background.  At the upper right, there's a
    monthly calendar you can use to switch days.  Below that, there's
    a <guilabel>TaskPad</guilabel>, where you can keep a list of tasks
    seperate from your calendar appointments.  The calendar's daily
    view is shown in <xref linkend="usage-calendar-fig">.

    <para>
       The toolbar offers you four different views of your calendar:
       one day, five days, a week, or a month at once. Press the
       calendar-shaped buttons on the right side of the toolbar to
       switch between views. You can also select a range of
       days&mdash; three days, ten days, a fortnight if you want
       &mdash; in the small calendar at the upper right.
    </para>
    <para>
       The <guibutton>Prev</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next</guibutton>
       buttons will move you forward and back in your calendar pages.
       If you're looking at only one day, you'll see tomorrow's page,
       or yesterday's.  If you're looking at your calendar by week,
       month, fortnight, or anything else, you'll move around by just
       that much. To come back to today's listing, click
       <guibutton>Today</guibutton>.
    </para>
    <para>
       To visit a specific date's calendar entries, click

    <title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
    <para>
      Of course, you'll want to use the calendar to do more than find
      out what day it is. This section will tell you how to schedule
      events, set alarms, and determine event recurrence.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="usage-calendar-apts-basic">
      <title>Creating events</title>
      <para>
	To create a new calendar event, select
        <menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	  <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Appointment</guimenuitem>

	or click the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button on the left end

        <title>Shortcut</title>
        <para>
           If you don't need to enter more information than the date
           and time of the appointment, you just click in any blank
           space in the calendar and start typing. You can enter other
           information later with the appointment editor.

      <para>
        Your event must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>. An <guilabel>All day event</guilabel>
        appears at the top of a day's event list rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have events that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day event, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        events.  Of course, events with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.

         <guilabel>Classification</guilabel> is a little more
         complicated, and only applies to calendars on a
         network. <guilabel>Public</guilabel> is the default category,
         and a public event can be viewed by anyone on the calendar
         sharing network.  <guilabel>Private</guilabel> denotes one
         level of security, and <guilabel>Confidential</guilabel> a
         higher level.  <!-- FIXME --> Exact determinations and

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Recurrence</guilabel> tab lets you describe
        repetition in events ranging from once every day up to once
        every 100 years.  You can then choose a time and date when the
        event will stop recurring, and, under
        <guilabel>Exceptions</guilabel>, pick individual days when the
        event will <emphasis>not</emphasis> recur. Make your
        selections from left to right, and you'll form a sentence:
        "Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3, 2003"
        or "Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences."

      <para>
	Once you're done with all those settings, click on the disk
	icon in the toolbar.  That will save the event and close the
	event editor window. If you want, you can alter an event
	summary in the calendar view by clicking on it and typing. You
	can change other settings by right-clicking on the event then
	choosing <guimenuitem>Edit this Appointment</guimenuitem>.

        Keelyn, the office manager for a small company, has one

        maintains one for the conference room, so people know when
        they can schedule meetings.  Next to that, she maintains a
        calendar that reflects when consultants are going to be on
