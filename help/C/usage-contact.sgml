  <title>Working with Your Contacts</title>
      <para>
        This chapter will show you how to use the
        <application>Evolution</application> addressbook to organize
        any amount of contact information, share addresses over a
        network, and several ways to save time with everyday tasks. To
        learn about configuring the addressbook, see <xref
        linkend="config-prefs-contact">. You can import contacts from
        other contact management tools with the Import tool by
        selecting
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem></menuchoice>,
        or by mailing them to yourself as vCard attachments.
      </para>

    <para>
       The toolbar for the addressbook is quite simple.
       <itemizedlist>

	  in a blank space in the contact list.

        <listitem><para> The <guiicon>stop sign</guiicon> icon stops loading
           contact data from the network.  This button is only
           relevant if you are looking at contact information on a
           network.  </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
       Your contact information fills the rest of the display.  Move
       through the cards alphabetically with the buttons and the
       scrollbar to the right of the window. Of course, if you have
       more than a few people listed, you'll want some way of finding
       them more quickly, which is why there's a search feature.
    </para>

      To delete a contact:

       If you want to add or change cards, you'll use the contact
       editor.  To change a card that already exists, double click on
       it to open the contact editor window.  If you want to create a new
       card, clicking the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button in the
       toolbar will open the same window, with blank entry boxes for
       you to fill in.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The contact editor window has two tabs,
      <guilabel>General</guilabel>, for basic contact information, and
      <guilabel>Details</guilabel>, for a more specific description of
      the person.  In addition, it contains a <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      menu and a toolbar with three items: <guilabel>Save and
      Close</guilabel>, <guilabel>Print</guilabel>, and
      <guilabel>Delete</guilabel>.

    <title>Organizing your Addressbook</title>
    <para>
       Organizing your addressbook is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the addressbook does not allow Virtual Folders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
    </para>

<!-- UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURE
    <para>
      Another useful <application>Evolution</application> feature is
      its ability to recognize when people live or work together.  If
      several people in your addressbook share an address, and you
      change the address for one of them,
      <application>Evolution</application> will ask you if you wish to
      change the address for all of them, or just for one.

    <sect2 id="usage-contact-organize-group">
      <title>Groups of contacts</title>
      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as elements of
         different categories.  To better integrate with email tools,
         you can also create lists of contacts that you can send mail
         to as a single person.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-folder">
	<title>Grouping with Folders</title>
	<para>
	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> folder.  If you've read <xref
	   linkend="usage-mainwindow"> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <menuchoice>
           <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	   <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
	   <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem>
           </menuchoice>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <xref
	   linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
	 </para>
	<para>
          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.
         </para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
	<title>Grouping with Categories</title>
	<para>
           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  
           That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </para>
	<para>
           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.
        </para>

       <!-- Feature Not Implemented
	<para>

           If the master list of categories doesn't suit you, you can
           add your own.  Just enter the new category's name in the

           choose <guilabel>Add to Master List</guilabel> in the

    <title>LDAP: Shared Addressbooks on a Network</title>

    <para>
      The <glossterm linkend="ldap">LDAP</glossterm> protocol was
      created to let users share contact information over a network by
      sharing access to a central address book.  LDAP allows a company
      to maintain a shared set of contact information for a company or
      department.  Many companies keep a common LDAP address book for
      all their employees or for client contacts.

       folders will appear inside the <guilabel>External
