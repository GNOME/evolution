  <title>Adding and creating address books</title>

  <p>You can have multiple address books. For example, you might have one
  address book for work related contacts and one for private contacts. The side
  bar lists those address books, and you can select which address book is
  shown.</p>

  <p>You can also use address books that are not on your computer, such as on
  the internet (e.g. Google) or in a local network (e.g. LDAP).</p>
