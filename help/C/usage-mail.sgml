  <abstract>
    <title> An Overview of the Evolution Mailer</title>
    <para>
       <application>Evolution</application> email is like other email
       programs in all the ways you would hope:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It can sort and organize your mail in a wide variety of ways with
	   folders, searches, and filters.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	  It can send and receive mail in HTML or as plain text, and
	  supports file attachments.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
	 <para>
	   It supports multiple mail sources, including IMAP, POP3,
	   and local <filename>mbox</filename> files.
	 </para>
       </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      However, <application>Evolution</application> has some important
      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">filtering</link> and <link
      linkend="usage-mail-organize-search">searching</link> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan mail
      volumes. There's also the <application>Evolution</application>
      <link linkend="usage-mail-organize-vFolders">vFolder</link>, an
      advanced organizational feature not found in other mail clients.
      If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every message you get
      in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find that feature
      especially useful.

    <title>Reading, Getting and Sending Mail</title>

    <sect2 id="usage-mail-getnsend-read">
      <title>Reading Mail</title>
      <para>
       You can start reading email by clicking
       <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> in the shortcut bar.  By
       default, the <interface>Inbox</interface> is open when you
       start <application>Evolution</application>, and the first
       time you see your Inbox, there's a message in it from Helix
       Code welcoming you to the application.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <application>Evolution</application>
	<guilabel>Inbox</guilabel>, should look like the one in <xref
	linkend="usage-mail-intro-fig">, which has a message from
	Helix Code. The message summary appears at the top, in the
	<interface>message list</interface>.  The message itself is
	displayed below that, in the <interface>view pane</interface>.
	If you find the <interface>view pane</interface> too small,
	you can double-click on the message in the <interface>message
	list</interface> to have it open in a new window.  Just like
	with folders, you can right-click on messages in the message
	list and get a menu of possible actions.

          You can also select the order in which messages appear in

      <title>Checking Mail</title>

      <para>
	Now that you've had a look around the
	<interface>Inbox</interface>, select the welcome message in
	the <interface>message list</interface> by clicking on it
	once.  Then click on the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button
	in the tool bar.  The message now has a line through it,
	because you've marked it for deletion.  If you really want to
	get rid of it, choose <guimenuitem>Expunge</guimenuitem> from
	the <guimenu>Actions</guimenu> menu.  That will delete it
	permanently. If you want to keep it, click
	<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> again, and it will no longer be
	marked as deleted.  At some point in the future, this feature
	will change to something a little less counter-intuitive.
      </para>


      <para>
	To check your email, just click <guibutton>Get
	mail</guibutton> in the toolbar.  If this is the first time
	you've done so, the <interface>mail setup
	assistant</interface> will ask you for the information it
	needs to check your mail (see <xref
	linkend="config-setupassist"> for more information).  If
	you're checking mail over a network (instead of from local
	<filename>mbox</filename> files), you'll need to enter your
	email password.  Type it in, click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and
	<application>Evolution</application> will download your mail.
	New mail will appear in your <interface>Inbox</interface>.
	<!-- FIXME: add mention of Today if Today feature appears -->
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you've entered your password,
        <application>Evolution</application> will hold it in memory so
        that you don't have to retype it every time you want to check
        mail.  It will only remember the password until you quit the
        application; each time you run
        <application>Evolution</application>, you need to re-enter
        your password.  If you'd like
        <application>Evolution</application> to forget your password
        sooner, select
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Actions</guimenu><guimenuitem>Forget
        Passwords</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and it will do so
        immediately.

	  display the file at the bottom of the message to which it's
	  attached.  Text, HTML, and most images will be displayed in
	  the message itself.  For other files,
	  <application>Evolution</application> will provide a link and
	  icon at the end of the message.  Click on that, and
	  <application>Evolution</application> will ask you where you
	  want to put the file.  Once you've chosen a location and
	  saved the file, you can open, move, copy, or execute it just
	  like any other, using <application>Nautilus</application> or
	  your favorite shell or file manager.
	</para>

	<para>
	   <application>Evolution</application> can also display

	    You can address your email in three different ways.  The

	  <para>
	    If you're writing to one person, but want to keep a third
	    party up to date, you can use <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel>.
	    Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
	    typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands
	    for "Carbon Copy."  Use it whenever you want to share a
	    message you've written to someone else.
	    <example>
	      <title>Using the Cc: field</title>
	      <para>
	         When Susan sends an email to a client, she puts her

	         <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> field, so that he know
	         what's going on.  The client can see that Tim also
	         received the message, and knows that he can talk to
	         Tim about the message as well.
	      </para>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you have a large number of recipients, or if you want
	    to send mail to several people without sharing the
	    recipient list, you should use
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel>. "Bcc" stands for "Blind Carbon
	    Copy", and means that people you put in the
	    <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> field get the message, but
	    nobody else sees their email address.  They will still see
	    the list of addresses from the <guilabel>To:</guilabel>
	    and <guilabel>Cc:</guilabel> fields, though.

	    <example id="ex-mail-bcc">

      <title>Getting Really Organized with Virtual Folders</title>
      <para>
	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<application>Evolution</application>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </para>
      <para>
	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  Once you've set it up, you'll be
	able to open it and read the messages in it as though it were
	a normal mail folder.  It's not a folder, though, because when
	you open a vFolder, <application>Evolution</application>
	performs a search for you.  It's not a regular search, though,
	because you can build a vFolder with a very complicated set of
	criteria with multiple inclusions and exclusions, as though
	you were setting up a filter.
      </para>

<!-- potentially useful, but doesn't fit at the moment:
     <para>
       An important difference between a folder and a virtual folder
	is that a conventional folder actually contains messages, but
	a vFolder is a view of messages that may be in several
	different folders.  This means that while a message may fall
	into several vFolders, it can be in only one conventional
	folder.  Also, it means that you cannot remove a message from
	a vFolder unless you delete it, and you cannot add a message
	to a vFolder unless you change the vFolder's search criteria.
      </para>
-->

      <para>
	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <application>Evolution</application> will
	automatically place them in and and remove them from the
	vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any vFolders which include it.
      </para>
      <para>
	That's pretty complicated, but it can be useful. For example,
	if I have a folder for all the email from one person, and
	another folder for all the email on a given topic, I
	<emphasis>feel</emphasis> organized.  But when the person
	sends me mail about the topic, my whole email filing universe
	becomes chaotic, and I need vFolders to save the day for me.
      </para>
      <para>
	That sounds silly, but imagine a business trying to keep track
	of mail from hundreds of vendors and clients, or a university
	with overlapping and changing groups of faculty, staff,
	administrators and students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less
	you can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.
      </para>

      <example id="usage-mail-organize-vFolders-ex">
	<title>Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</title>
	<para>
	   To organize my mail box, I can set up a vFolder for emails
	   from my friend Vince.  Then, whenever I want to see the
	   messages Vince has sent me, I open the vFolder, and every
	   message he's sent me shows up, no matter where I've
	   actually filed it.  If I want, I can also create a vFolder
	   containing any message from my list of co-workers which
	   also has the name of the project in it.  That way, when
	   Vince sends me mail about the project, I can see that
	   message both in the "Vince" vFolder and in the "Project"
	   vFolder.  That's because when I open up the "Vince" folder,
	   I'm really performing a search for all the mail from Vince,
	   and when I open the "Project" folder I'm really performing
	   a search for all the mail about the project.

	<!--  (INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: vFolders in action) -->

	</para>
      </example>
      <para>
	 To create a vFolder, select <guimenuitem>VFolder
	 Editor</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
	 menu in the <interface>main window</interface>.  This
	 will bring up a dialog box that looks suspiciously like
	 the Filter Assistant (for more information on filters, see
	 <xref linkend="usage-mail-organize-filters">), and which
	 presents you with a list of vFolders you have previously
	 created. If you have already created vFolders, you can
	 click on them in the frame labelled <guilabel>Select Rule
	 Type</guilabel>, and edit or remove them.  If you have
	 not created any, there will be only one available option:
	 click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a new vFolder.
      </para>
      <para>
	 You can enter a name for your vFolder in the
	 <guilabel>Name</guilabel>.  Then, tell
	 <application>Evolution</application> what messages to look
	 for.  This process is exactly like filter creation: decide
	 between <guilabel>Match all parts</guilabel> and
	 <guilabel>Match any part</guilabel>, then choose what part of
	 the message to look in, what sort of matching to perform, and
	 specify exactly what text it is that you want to find.
       </para>
       <para>
         The second part, however, is slightly different.  In the
         section of the window labelled <guilabel>vFolder Sources
         </guilabel> is a list of folders in which
         <application>Evolution</application> will search for the contents
         of your vFolder.  Click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a folder,
         or <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> to remove one.
