<title>I cannot see some emails, where are they?</title>

<list>
 <item>
  <p>Check whether you are using filters on incoming (or outgoing) messages. These could be automatically moving your messages to another destination.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Check your search view in the search bar right above the message list. Perhaps the <gui>Show</gui> dropdown list is set to a filter like <gui>Read Messages</gui>, or the text input filed contains some value. Click the broom icon to clear the search field.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>If you cannot see any emails at all in a folder, check that you have not maximized the message preview (so the message list pane is hidden). To do this, click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Preview</gui><gui>Show Message Preview</gui></guiseq>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Look in the <gui>Junk</gui> folder. Messages that are marked as Junk disappear from the original folder and are moved to the <gui>Junk</gui> folder.
  </p>
 </item>
 <!-- Does the following option still exist? -->
 <item>
  <p>Click <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Show Deleted Messages</gui></guiseq> to make sure all messages are visible.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Check your default folder under <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui><gui>Email Accounts</gui><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Defaults</gui></guiseq>. Perhaps it is set to some other folder than the folder you thought of.</p>
