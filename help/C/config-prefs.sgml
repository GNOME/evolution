        Perhaps your mail server has changed names.  Perhaps you've
        grown tired of a certain layout for your appointments.
        Whatever the reason, you want to change your
        <application>Evolution</application> settings.  This chapter
        will tell you how to do just that.
      </para>
      <para>
        Evolution 1.2 brings with it a redesigned comprehensive
        settings window that you can open by choosing <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Configure</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, no matter
        where you are in Evolution. On the left half of the settings
        window is a column, similar to the Evolution shortcut bar,
        which lets you choose which portion of Evolution to
        customize. The right half of the window is where you'll make
        your actual changes.

Your system administrator may ask you to connect to a specific port on
a mail server. To specify which port you use, just type a colon and
the port number after the server name. For example, to connect to port

         HTML, and to specify which of them will be added to emails
         you create in the message composer.  If you prefer to use an
         alternate signature or none at all, you can select it from
         the mail composer itself.

    <para>
       In the spell-checking tool, you can set spelling options,
       including the language or languages you will use. Note that you
       must install the gnome-spell package, available through Red
       Carpet, for spell-checking to be available in
       Evolution. Alternate dictionaries are also available through
       Red Carpet and are detected automatically if you have installed
       them.

          <para>
            Newsgroups are so much like mailing lists that there's no
            reason not to keep them right next to your mail.  When you
            first select the <guilabel>News Servers</guilabel> tab,
            you will see a blank box with the three familiar buttons
            on the right: <guibutton>Add</guibutton>,
            <guibutton>Edit</guibutton>, and
            <guibutton>Delete</guibutton>.
          </para>
          <para>
            Click <guibutton>Add</guibutton> to add a news server; you
            will be prompted for its name.  Enter the name, click
            <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, and you're done.  You can have
            as many news servers as you like, of course.  News servers
            will appear next to your IMAP servers in the
            <interface>folder bar</interface>.
