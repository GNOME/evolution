        Perhaps your mail server has changed names.  Perhaps you've
        grown tired of a certain layout for your appointments.
        Whatever the reason, you want to change your
        <application>Evolution</application> settings.  This chapter
        will tell you how to do just that.
      </para>
      <para>
        Evolution 1.2 brings with it a redesigned comprehensive
        settings window that you can open by choosing <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, no matter
        where you are in Evolution. On the left half of the settings
        window is a column, similar to the Evolution shortcut bar,
        which lets you choose which portion of Evolution to
        customize. The right half of the window is where you'll make
        your actual changes.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
             Here, add or change information about your email
             accounts: the servers to which you connect, the way you
             download mail, your password authentication mode, and so
             forth. This is the most complex item in the list, and is
             covered in <xref linkend="config-prefs-mail-identity"/>.

		      Set the maximum number of results for a given
                      search. Most servers refuse to send more than
                      500, but you can set the number lower if you
                      want to shorten downloads for very broad
                      searches.
