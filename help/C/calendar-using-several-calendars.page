  <title>Using several calendars</title>

  <p>You can have multiple calendars and overlay them one over the other. For
  example, you might have a schedule of events for work, one for home, and one
  for your favorite sports team. The side bar lists those calendars, and you
  can select or deselect the boxes next to them to show and hide the
  appointments in your calendar view. By hiding and showing different sets of
  appointments, you can be sure to avoid conflicts, while keeping a minimum of
  clutter in your view.</p>

  <p>Appointments for each calendar appear in different color.</p>

  <p>You can also use calendars that are not on your computer, such as on the
  internet or in a local network.</p>

  <p>For example, the
  <link href="http://icalshare.com">icalshare.com website</link> has an
  extensive list of shared online calendars, including national and religious
  holidays, phases of the moon, sports, and local and regional events.</p>
