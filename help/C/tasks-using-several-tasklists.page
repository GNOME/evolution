<title>Using several task lists or memo lists</title>

<p>You can have multiple task or memo lists and choose which of your lists get displayed. For example, you might have tasks for work, tasks for home, and tasks for the singing club of which you are a member. The sidebar shows these lists, and you can select or deselect any of the boxes next to them to show and hide the corresponding tasks or memos in your view.</p>

<p>Tasks and memos from each task or memo list appear in a different color.</p>

<p>You can also use lists that are not on your computer, such as on the internet.</p>
<p>New tasks are created in the selected task list in the Tasks window. If no list is selected, new tasks are created in the default task list. Likewise for memos.</p>
