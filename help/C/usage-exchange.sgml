    <title>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</title>
    <para>
    The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange allows Ximian
    Evolution clients to access accounts on Microsoft Exchange 2000
    servers. It is available through Ximian Red Carpet in its own
    channel, but cannot be used without a license file.  The license
    file may be purchased from the Ximian online store at <ulink
    url="http://store.ximian.com">store.ximian.com</ulink>. Unlike the
    regular Ximian Evolution client, the Ximian Connector for
    Microsoft Exchange is proprietary software and source code is not
    available.
    </para>
   
  <warning id="licensing">
    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Ximian Connector works only with Exchange 2000, and requires
      that Outlook Web Access be enabled. Each user will need a
      valid Microsoft Exchange 2000 server account, including license.

    <title>Accessing the <application>Exchange</application>Server</title>
    <para>
      Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for
      <application>Exchange</application>accounts is stored on the
      server, not on your desktop computer.  This means that you can
      access it from multiple locations. It also means that your
      Microsoft <application>Exchange</application>account information
      is in a separate folder tree from the <guilabel>Local</guilabel>
      tree in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree,
      with the name you gave the account. If you have multiple
      accounts, you will have multiple folder trees.
    </para>
    <para>
      Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
      have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
      cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
      are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
      to add to your <application>Exchange</application>stores, you
      can copy and paste them over, or just drag items from one folder
      to another as you would with two local stores.

	<title>Saving Attached Addresses and Appointments</title>
	<para>
          If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail
          account, you should be aware that whenever you save an email
          address or appointment from an email message, it will be
          saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar, rather
          than in your local account. The same is true of
          synchronization with Palm-OS devices: tasks, appointments,
          and addresses from your Palm-OS device will be synchronized
          with those in the Exchange folders rather than local
          folders.

          To avoid unnecessary strain on the server, the GAL will
          appear empty until you have searched for something in it.
          If you want to display all the cards in the list, click in
          the search box and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  This
          enters a blank search: since every card contains a blank in

      <para>
        When you schedule a meeting with your calendar on the

        other local Exchange users are busy according to their

          Reminders for appointments in your Exchange calendar will
          not work until you have run Evolution at least once after
          logging in. This is different from locally stored reminders,
          which will work from the moment you log in, regardless of
          whether you have run Evolution in the session.

         If meeting attendees are not available during the times you

         or backward to the nearest available time.  To do so, just
         click the arrows to the left or right of the
         <guilabel>Autopick</guilabel> button. The autopick tool will
         move the meeting to the nearest time during which all
         attendees are available.  If you aren't satisfied with those
         results, you can drag the edges of the meeting time to the
         hours that you want to select.
